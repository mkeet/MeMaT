O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

Invalid authentication
This server does not support this type of authentication and may not support authentication at all.
Are you sure you want to send a message in HTML format?
Are you sure you want to send a message without a subject?
Adding a meaningful Subject line to your messages will give your recipients an idea of what your mail is about.
Are you sure you want to send a message with only BCC recipients?
The contact list you are sending to is configured to hide list recipients. Many email systems add an Apparently-To header to messages that only have BCC recipients. This header, if added, will list all of your recipients in your message. To avoid this, you should add at least one To: or CC: recipient.
Many email systems add an Apparently-To header to messages that only have BCC recipients. This header, if added, will list all of your recipients to your message anyway. To avoid this, you should add at least one To: or CC: recipient.
Please enter a valid email address in the To: field. You can search for email addresses by clicking on the To: button next to the entry box.

The '/' name can only be a directory, not a key
Value for `%s' set in a read-only source at the front of your configuration path
Unable to store a value at key '%s', as the configuration server has no writable databases. There are some common causes of this problem: 1) your configuration path file %s/path doesn't contain any databases or wasn't found 2) somehow we mistakenly created two gconfd processes 3) your operating system is misconfigured so NFS file locking doesn't work in your home directory or 4) your NFS client machine crashed and didn't properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped. If you have two gconfd processes (or had two at the time the second was launched), logging out, killing all copies of gconfd, and logging back in may help. If you have stale locks, remove ~/.gconf*/*lock. Perhaps the problem is that you attempted to use GConf from two machines at once, and ORBit still has its default configuration that prevents remote CORBA connections - put "ORBIIOPIPv4=1" in /etc/orbitrc. As always, check the user.* syslog for details on problems gconfd encountered. There can only be one gconfd per home directory, and it must own a lockfile in ~/.gconfd and also lockfiles in individual storage locations such as ~/.gconf

_Use cellspan
If checked GTM will replace any rectangular sections of identically colored blocks with one large cell with ROWSPAN and COLSPAN values.
Co_mpress TD tags

When enabled, this will ensure that each pixel of an image gets mapped to a pixel on the screen.
This is the distance in pixels where Guide and Grid snapping activates.
Tools such as fuzzy-select and bucket fill find regions based on a seed-fill algorithm. The seed fill starts at the initially selected pixel and progresses in all directions until the difference of pixel intensity from the original is greater than a specified threshold. This value represents the default threshold.

About the GNOME Desktop
Welcome to the GNOME Desktop
Brought to you by:

Build Date
GNOME is a Free, usable, stable, accessible desktop environment for the Unix-like family of operating systems.
GNOME includes most of what you see on your computer, including the file manager, web browser, menus, and many applications.
GNOME also includes a complete development platform for applications programmers, allowing the creation of powerful and complex applications.
GNOME's focus on usability and accessibility, regular release cycle, and strong corporate backing make it unique among Free Software desktops.
GNOME's greatest strength is our strong community. Virtually anyone, with or without coding skills, can contribute to making GNOME better.
Hundreds of people have contributed code to GNOME since it was started in 1997; many more have contributed in other important ways, including translations, documentation, and quality assurance.

Profile to use for new terminals
Profile to be used when opening a new window or tab. Must be in profile_list.
Whether the menubar has access keys
Whether to have Alt+letter access keys for the menubar. They may interfere with some applications run inside the terminal so it's possible to turn them off.
Whether the standard GTK shortcut for menubar access is enabled
Normally you can access the menubar with F10. This can also be customized via gtkrc (gtk-menu-bar-accel = "whatever"). This option allows the standard menubar accelerator to be disabled.
[UTF-8,current]
List of available encodings
A subset of possible encodings are presented in the Encoding submenu. This is a list of encodings to appear there. The special encoding name "current" means to display the encoding of the current locale.
Whether to ask for confirmation when closing terminal windows
Whether to ask for confirmation when closing a terminal window which has more than one open tab.
Human-readable name of the profile
Human-readable name of the profile.
Whether to show menubar in new windows/tabs
True if the menubar should be shown in new windows, for windows/tabs with this profile.
Default color of text in the terminal
Default color of text in the terminal, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red").
Default color of terminal background
Default color of terminal background, as a color specification (can be HTML-style hex digits, or a color name such as "red").
What to do with dynamic title
If the application in the terminal sets the title (most typically people have their shell set up to do this), the dynamically-set title can erase the configured title, go before it, go after it, or replace it. The possible values are "replace", "before", "after", and "ignore".
Title for terminal
Title to display for the terminal window or tab. This title may be replaced by or combined with the title set by the application inside the terminal, depending on the title_mode setting.
Whether to allow bold text
If true, allow applications in the terminal to make text boldface.
Whether to silence terminal bell
If true, don't make a noise when applications send the escape sequence for the terminal bell.
Characters that are considered "part of a word"
When selecting text by word, sequences of these characters are considered single words. Ranges can be given as "A-Z". Literal hyphen (not expressing a range) should be the first character given.
Position of the scrollbar
Number of lines to keep in scrollback
Whether to scroll to the bottom when a key is pressed
If true, pressing a key jumps the scrollbar to the bottom.
Whether to scroll to the bottom when there's new output
If true, whenever there's new output the terminal will scroll to the bottom.
What to do with the terminal when the child command exits
Possible values are "close" to close the terminal, and "restart" to restart the command.
Whether to launch the command in the terminal as a login shell
If true, the command inside the terminal will be launched as a login shell. (argv[0] will have a hyphen in front of it.)
Whether to update login records when launching terminal command
If true, the system login records utmp and wtmp will be updated when the command inside the terminal is launched.
Whether to run a custom command instead of the shell
If true, the value of the custom_command setting will be used in place of running a shell.
Whether to blink the cursor
Custom command to use instead of the shell
Run this command in place of the shell, if use_custom_command is true.
Icon for terminal window
Icon to use for tabs/windows containing this profile.
Palette for terminal applications
Terminals have a 16-color palette that applications inside the terminal can use. This is that palette, in the form of a colon-separated list of color names. Color names should be in hex format e.g. "#FF00FF"
Font
An Pango font name. Examples are "Sans 12" or "Monospace Bold 14".
Background type
Background image
Filename of a background image.
Whether to scroll background image
If true, scroll the background image with the foreground text; if false, keep the image in a fixed position and scroll the text above it.
How much to darken the background image
A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how much to darken the background image. 0.0 means no darkness, 1.0 means fully dark. In the current implementation, there are only two levels of darkness possible, so the setting behaves as a boolean, where 0.0 disables the darkening effect.
Effect of the Backspace key
Sets what code the backspace key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "ascii-del" is normally considered the correct setting for the Backspace key.
Effect of the Delete key
Sets what code the delete key generates. Possible values are "ascii-del" for the ASCII DEL character, "control-h" for Control-H (AKA the ASCII BS character), "escape-sequence" for the escape sequence typically bound to backspace or delete. "escape-sequence" is normally considered the correct setting for the Delete key.
Whether to use the colors from the theme for the terminal widget
If true, the theme color scheme used for text entry boxes will be used for the terminal, instead of colors provided by the user.
Whether to use the system font
If true, the terminal will use the desktop-global standard font if it's monospace (and the most similar font it can come up with otherwise).

Window %s sets an MWM hint indicating it isn't resizable, but sets min size %d x %d and max size %d x %d; this doesn't make much sense.
Window 0x%lx has property %s that was expected to have type %s format %d and actually has type %s format %d n_items %d. This is most likely an application bug, not a window manager bug. The window has title="%s" class="%s" name="%s"
