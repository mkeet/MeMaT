out of water, unless steps are taken now to manage the demand for water
more efficiently.
why should you harvest rainwater?
Collecting and using your own water resource through rainwater harvesting
is your insurance policy against short-term water shortages.
You can obtain
500 ℓ of water if 5 mm of rain is collected on a 100 m2 roof.
showering or topping up the pool.
Rainwater tanks may also be plumbed to
feed toilet cisterns, reducing the considerable amount of water used daily for
flushing. You can install your tanks either to stand against a wall of your house
under the roof eaves, or unobtrusively anywhere in your garden by using an
underground piping system, which may be supplied by your rainwater
system supplier.
your roof as a collection surface
The most efficient roof surface for harvesting rainwater is a metal roof, which
may be corrugated iron, flat iron sheet or IBR (inverted box rib) profile.
Tiled roofs may also be used, but are not as efficient as metal for collecting
rainwater.
You cannot harvest rainwater from a thatched roof.
here are some average calculations for the two roof types:
• 11 mm of rainfall on metal roofs can produce 1 000 ℓ of harvested rainwater for
every 100 m2 of roof area.
• 16 mm of rainfall on tiled roofs can produce 1 000 ℓ of harvested rainwater for
every 100 m2 of roof area. The use of rainwater tanks in summer rainfall areas can be more beneficial
2
a rainwater harvesting system can:
• Save valuable potable water
• Save you money and
• Relieve the strain on our natural environment
the basic rainwater harvesting system
The basic rainwater harvesting system is very simple to install.
Gravity takes
rainwater collecting on your roof to water tanks via your downpipes.
Some
kind of rainwater filtering system is usually installed to prevent suspended
particles from entering the tanks.
Your system supplier will specify the
suitable size and number of rainwater tanks required according to individual
user needs.
The rainwater is then pumped from the rainwater tanks to the
whole household, or to the garden for irrigation.
3
The right size rainwater storage tank depends on your unique circumstances.
the following factors may all influence your decision:
• The number of people using water in the household
• The roof area from which you are harvesting
• The type of roof from which you are harvesting
The average tank size ranges from 1 500 ℓ to 2 500 ℓ and 5 000 ℓ.
Your rainwater harvesting system supplier will assess your individual
circumstances and water needs, and advise you on the size and number of
water tanks you will need.
save on municipal sewerage
effluent charges
The municipality charges for water and sewerage according to a block-tariff
system.
You are being charged for sewerage based only on the volume
(number of kilolitres) of water that you consume, namely on 70% of the
water that runs through the meter.
By using rainwater, the water flow through your meter will be reduced, with
considerable water account savings for the homeowner.
rainwater used for human consumption
Due to possible suspended particles in the water, and increased acid levels in
rainwater as a result of air pollution, it is not advisable to use rainwater for
human consumption.
1 you can place your rainwater tank anywhere in your garden where it is
unobtrusive and out of sight.
2 the rainwater is pumped from your tank to your household or garden.
3 Use your rainwater to keep your garden green and healthy.

HOW MUCH WOULD THIS SERVICE COST?
The Office of the City Ombudsman provides a
FREE complaints-handling service to residents.
3.
WHAT ISSUES WILL THE OMBUDSMAN
UNDERTAKE ON MY BEHALF?
The Ombudsman’s Office is a place of lastresort.
It normally requires confirmation that a
complainant has exhausted all available
avenues within the line departments first
before resorting to the Ombudsman.
For this reason the Ombudsman may refer
a complaint to the Customer Relations
department or relevant line department or
Subcouncil as a first port of call.
We can investigate matters where the
municipality:
• Did not respond to an enquiry, complaint or
other correspondence
• Provided a poor service (for e.g. non-
collection of refuse, failure to cut grass in
public spaces, etc)
• Disregarded the principles of Batho Pele
(people first), resulting in people being sent
from pillar to post
• Did not follow procedures on matters that
the office can investigate, e.g . issuing a
summons without receiving a letter of
demand first • Has not acted properly or fairly.
We cannot investigate matters concerning:
• Political decisions and conduct of councillors
• Insurance claims
• Labour/union matters
• Tenders/contracts with the City
• Complaints about gross financial irregularities,
fraud and corruption.
This is the role of the City’s Internal Audit
department and Forensic Service

4.
WHEN SHOULD I LODGE A COMPLAINT WITH
THE OFFICE OF THE CITY OMBUDSMAN?
The Ombudsman’s Office acts as a last internal
resort and the process is a voluntary option for
conflict resolution.
5.
WHEN CAN I EXPECT A REPLY/ RESPONSE
FROM THE CITY OMBUDSMAN?
We undertake to respond to all communications
within seven to ten days of receipt (unless
prescribed otherwise).
6.
HOW DO I COMPLAIN?
• You can visit our office and complete the
complaint form or alternatively e-mail, write
or fax your complaint to us.
You must
describe the problem, what happened, who
was present and who said what.
• You may also download the prescribed form
from our webpage:
www.capetown.gov.za/en/cityombudsman
in English, Afrikaans or Xhosa.
• You may also call the office but you will still
be required to complete a complaint form.
7.
IN ORDER FOR US TO ASSIST YOU BETTER,
WE NEED THE FOLLOWING:
• Make sure that you give sufficient
information in your complaint, such as the
names of people you have dealt with,
pertinent dates and times.
Attach copies of
relevant documents.
• Should you phone in with a complaint, we
will take down your details and ask you to
complete a complaint form and send it to
the office. • Sign your complaint (if you are not able to
write, someone at the office will help you).
• Once the office has received your form, we
will decide whether the Office of the
Ombudsman is the right place to handle the
matter.
• If not, we will explain why we cannot handle
it, and suggest alternative remedies.

programme
Foreword
The Waste Wise Programme
The City of Cape Town initiated the Waste Wise Programme in 2002 to help minimise waste,
illegal dumping and littering in Cape Town.
The main aim of the programme is to educate all
Capetonians about the realities and consequences of waste, and ultimately, to show people
how they can be part of the solution in doing their bit to protect the environment.
In 2006, Cape Town became one of the first cities in Africa to implement an Integrated Waste
Management Plan.
One of the key goals of this plan is to reduce the amount of waste sent to
Cape Town’s landfills by 25% over the next few years.
In order to achieve this goal by 2012,
the City needs to develop and roll out effective systems of waste separation and recycling.
Educating Cape Town’s future citizens
One of the key subprojects of the Waste Wise Programme is to develop and implement an
effective education and recycling programme for schools in Cape Town.
The objectives of this
programme are as follows:
• To raise awareness among educators, learners and their families
• To enable educators to raise awareness of the cause and effect of poor waste
management and the benefits of integrated waste management
• To provide environmental tools to enhance the quality of life for Capetonians
• To assist schools with portfolio development and waste minimisation projects
So far, 100 schools in Cape Town have participated in the Waste Wise School Programme,
and with the assistance of this booklet, we hope that your school will be the next to join.
The booklet will provide you with all the information as well as practical tips and advice you’ll
need to start and manage a successful waste management and recycling programme at your
school.
Good luck, we’re sure you’ll find it to be a highly exciting and rewarding initiative!

Why Waste is such a problem
It is an alarming fact that the amount of waste we generate in Cape Town
is growing faster than our city’s population.
You have probably heard about
carbon emissions, the depletion of the ozone layer, climate change and the
problem of sustainability.
All of these issues relate to global warming and the
very real crisis that is currently facing Planet Earth.
What is global warming?
Carbon dioxide and other gases keep the
earth’s surface warm by trapping heat
from the sun inside the atmosphere.
This
heat is necessary in order to sustain life
on the planet.
However, by burning fossil
fuels such as coal, oil and gas – and by
destroying forests around the world – we
have drastically increased the levels of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and this is
causing temperatures to rise.
Almost all scientists agree that we are
already experiencing the negative effects
of global warming. Glaciers are melting,
plants and animals are no longer able to
survive in their natural habitats, and we are
experiencing erratic weather patterns (such
as storms and droughts) more often.
The
rise in temperature is a very real threat to
our planet, and human behaviour is directly
responsible for it.
I agree that global warming is a real problem, but what does it
have to do with waste?
When waste or rubbish is not managed
properly, it causes different types of
The greenhouse gas methane is
one example.
Methane, which is 24 times
more harmful to the environment than
carbon dioxide, is produced when the
organic waste in landfill sites decays without
Furthermore, landfills can also pollute soil
and groundwater.
Considering the fact that
the earth is a closed system, all resources
that we remove from the system by burying
them in landfills or burning them, are lost to
us forever.

FAST FACTS: What is a landfill site?
• A landfill site – commonly known as a
tip – is a scientifically chosen, designed,
engineered and managed location for the
disposal of waste.
It needs to be relatively
close to where waste is generated in
order to limit transportation costs.
• Modern landfills are lined with watertight
plastic sheeting, but in the case of old
landfills, natural clay barriers are relied
upon to prevent toxic leaks.
• On delivery, waste is spread, compacted
and covered with soil, sand and rubble.
Once buried, it lies there to decompose,
but this takes an extremely long time.
A
plastic bottle, for example, can take up
to 1 000 years to decompose completely.
Newspapers from 100 years ago were
recently discovered at a landfill site in
New York – and they were still perfectly
readable!
Just hoW baD is the Waste
problem iN cape toWN?
Capetonians produce 6 000 tons of waste
every single day – that is between 1,7 and
2 kg of waste per resident per day.
Annually,
the Western Cape disposes of enough waste
to fill a row of trucks equalling the distance
from Cape Town to Gauteng; that is 1 200
km!
All of this waste ends up at one of
Cape Town’s three remaining landfill sites:
Vissershok, Bellville South and Coastal Park.
The amount of waste going to our landfills
is growing too rapidly, and it is becoming
increasingly difficult to find geologically
suitable sites for new landfills.
This means that we can do one of two
things: transport our waste greater
distances, which will lead to far higher
service tariffs for Capetonian households
and businesses, OR we all need to commit to
minimising waste.
How can we minimise waste?
We can minimise the total output of waste
by making an effort to reduce, reuse and
recycle.
FAST FACTS: In metropolitan Cape Town (2 487 km²) …
• waste generation increased by 7% over
each year);
the past year – this is more than the
population growth rate;
• Capetonians generate a total of 7 100
tons of waste every day (roughly 10 000
tons per working day, or 2,5 million tons
4
• only 14% of this waste gets recycled; and
• without intervention, Cape Town will be
generating four million tons of waste per
year by 2012.
Why shoulD schools Get iNVolVeD?
Now that we know why waste needs
to be managed properly – and that
Cape Town is facing a potential waste
crisis – we arrive at the next important
question: Why is it important for schools
to get actively involved?
Here are
some of the most important benefits
of implementing waste management
• It instils the right values and behaviour
in our children: By teaching our scholars
what needs to be done to take care
of our environment, and how each
person can make a positive contribution,
we’re producing a future generation of
environmentally friendly citizens.
It presents the school with new learning
opportunities: Recycling at school is an
exciting way to enrich the curriculum, as it
offers a realistic context for learning.
sustainability: Implementing a waste
management programme can be a great
first step towards making your school
more sustainable.

Before looking at how your school can
reduce, reuse or recycle the waste it
generates, we need to take a look at the

types of waste and different waste streams
that you may be dealing with.
two different waste classes
The first step we need to take in order to
get wise with waste is to understand the
two different classes of waste.
All waste is
divided into two categories based on the
5
environment:
• The first category is general waste, i.e.
waste that does not pose an immediate
threat to man or to the environment.
Examples of general waste include
household waste, builder’s rubble, garden
waste, etc.
Although it is not immediately
toxic, general waste can produce leachate
over time, which is very harmful to the
environment.
• The second category is hazardous
waste, i.e. waste that is legally defined
as 'hazardous' in the state in which it is
generated. Waste is classed as hazardous
based on its chemical reactivity or toxicity,
explosiveness, corrosiveness, or other
characteristics that cause, or are likely to
Learners at your school will need to
understand both waste classes, so as to be
able to distinguish between waste which is
safe to recycle, and that which needs to be
managed outside of the school’s recycling
programme.
GeNeral Waste streams
Next, you will need to know about each of the different waste streams in
order to identify which forms of waste can and cannot be recycled.
or burnt – they can all be recycled!
tins and metals
We all buy canned foods and beverages on
a daily basis.
Have you ever stopped to think
about what happens to the can once you
throw it away?
Does it become part of the
400 tons of used cans that are recycled in
the Western Cape every month?
Collect-a-Can claims to recycle 66% of all
beverage cans in South Africa, providing
a source of income to more than 37 000
'collection entrepreneurs'.
The recycled
metals are used to make new products
of the same quality – thus conserving
irreplaceable natural resources.
There is a huge demand for steel scrap metals
worldwide; in fact, South Africa exports up
to 50% of the scrap it recovers.
6
cardboard and paper
Cardboard and paper are excellent materials
for recycling.
For every ton of paper that
is recycled, 17 trees are saved, and 40%
less energy and 30% less water is needed
to produce new paper.
Today, recovered
paper is the most important raw material in
the production of paper and cardboard in
South Africa.
In addition, many well-known
South African newspapers are being printed
on paper that contains 25% recycled paper pulp.
Below is a list of the paper types that
can be recycled.
(Remember to remove
staples, sellotape, Prestik and pins/paper clips.)
• Old memos/letters
• Computer paper
• Used photocopy paper
• Windowless envelopes
• Old books
• Pale-coloured paper (invoices, etc.)
• Newspapers
• Magazines
• Cardboard (flattened)
Glass
The following cannot recycle:
• Wet or dirty paper (tissues, paper towel,
food wrappings, paper with spills)
• Wax or plastic-coated packaging for
liquids (milk cartons)
• Self-adhesive paper (Post-it™ notes)
• Carbon paper
• Chemically treated fax or photographic
paper
• Dog food bags, potato bags, wax-coated
boxes
Glass is almost 100% recyclable.
More than
185 000 tons of glass is recovered and recycled
in South Africa every year.
Green, amber and
clear glass can be recycled, and it does not matter
if the bottles or jars are broken. Remember to
remove bottle tops (recyclable plastics), lids (metal
ones are recyclable as well) and corks from the
glass before placing it in recycling bins.
Did you know?
Recycling a glass bottle saves enough electricity to
light a 100 W bulb for four hours; and for every
ton of glass recycled, 1,2 tons of raw material and
114 l of oil is saved.
7
plastics
Recycling plastics is easy.
The trick is to make sure
you know which plastics can be recycled separately, and which should only be recycled together.
Typically, the following kinds of plastics are grouped together for recycling:
1.
PET: Polyethylene terephthalate –
carbonated softdrink bottles, juice and
mineral water bottles, some jars, some
household cleaners and food trays
2.
HD-PE: High-density polyethylene –
deeply coloured opaque bottles (milk,
scouring powder, fabric softener,
household cleaners, salt, etc.),
supermarket carryout bags
3.
PVC: Polyvinyl chloride – clear plastic
bottles, clear trays for foods and toiletries
4.
LD-PE: Low-density polyethylene –
frozen-vegetable bags, garbage bags,
building film, soft supermarket carryout
bags, fridge bags, soft squeezable bottles
5.
PP: Polypropylene – most yoghurt,
screw-on bottle caps, potato chip bags,
straws and lunch boxes
6.
PS: Polystyrene – some yoghurt and
similar containers (if they crack when
bent sharply), take-away food tubs,
clear meat pack trays, egg packs, disposable cutlery
7. Other – automotive and appliance
When it comes to recycling plastics, the
'wash and squash' rule applies – rinse the
container, and then squash it. Paper labels

• Compound plastic packaging (such as
Tetrapak milk and fruit juice cartons)
– Tetrapak is already recyclable in
Johannesburg and may soon be in Cape
Town
• Polystyrene food trays
Tetrapak is recyclable.
For more information
on Tetrapak recycling, write to: contactus@
tetrapak.co.za
If Capetonians were to say no to products
with packaging that cannot be recycled,
a strong message would be sent to
manufacturers to design and package their
products in a more environmentally
friendly way.
However, plastic caps should be thrown
away, since they are usually made of a
different type of plastic than the container,
and cannot be recycled easily.
Unfortunately, many plastic packaging items
are still not recyclable in South Africa, but
this is changing rapidly as more leading
retailers work to ensure that all their
packaging is acceptable for recycling, or that
there is sufficient interest and quantities to
recycle a greater range of plastics. Currently,
plastics that cannot be recycled include the following:
• Multi-laminated plastic foils (for food
packaging such as bacon)
organic waste
Creating compost from organic
waste (such as leftover foods,
vegetable peelings) saves space in our
landfills and, in turn, decreases the
amount of methane gas produced at landfill sites.
In addition, it puts important nutrients back into the
ground and thus nourishes the earth.
electronic waste (e-waste)
E-waste includes computers, TVs,
stereos, DVD players, fax machines,
cellphones, and other electronic
household appliances that have been
thrown away by their original owners.
E-waste should definitely be recycled,
because it is a valuable source of
secondary raw materials.
It will also become toxic if it is not treated and
discarded properly.

turNiNG your school iNto a
Waste Warrior
• Reuse materials to prevent them from
becoming waste • Set up a waste recycling programme at
your school
Now that we understand the two different
types of waste and the various waste
streams, let’s take a look at the five steps
your school needs to take in order to
become a waste warrior:
• Set up a waste management committee
for the school
• Conduct a waste audit
• Reduce the waste your school produces
settiNG up a Waste
maNaGemeNt committee
The first step in setting up a successful waste
management programme in your school
is to ensure that all parties that will affect
the programme’s success, namely school
management, educators, parents, learners
and the school’s cleaning staff, buy into
the idea, and are committed to making it
work. One of the best ways to do this is
to create a waste project committee that
includes representatives from each of the
abovementioned groups.
The waste coordinator
Your first requirement will be to identify the
school’s waste coordinator (leading waste
champion). Ideally, this will be a fairly senior
educator within the school (someone from
within top school management).
The waste
coordinator will be responsible for heading
up the waste management committee,
and coordinating the waste management
programme in the school.
More specifically, he/she will need to:
• take responsibility for initiating, planning
and implementing the waste audits;
• develop and drive the implementation of
action plans to reduce, reuse and recycle
waste within the school environment;
• raise awareness of the school’s waste
management programme and highlight
the roles that each of the key groups
need to play to make it a success;
Depending on how the teaching body is
structured, these educators should ideally
come from different areas of the school – for
example, one educator could come from the
academic side, one from the arts and crafts
side, and one from the sporting side.
Representatives from the
parent body
The success of the waste management
programme, specifically the school’s
recycling centre, will depend on support
from the parent body (bringing waste
to school from home for recycling, and
offering to help in the recycling centre). It is,
therefore, vital to have parents on the waste
management committee.
Since parents are only involved with the
school while their children are studying
there, it is important that an ongoing
parenting body, such as the Parents
Association, assists in making sure that two
or three committed parents are available
to be part of the waste management
committee each year.
It may actually be a
good idea to ask the Parents Association to
take responsibility for electing the parents
that will take part on an annual basis.
• provide training for other school staff;
• set up and chair regular meetings
with the school’s waste management
committee;
• keep the school’s head educator and
management informed; and
• raise awareness within the surrounding
community, the press and local businesses
with the objective of generating support/
financial assistance for the initiative.
Representatives from top
school management
It would be ideal if the school’s principal
could be directly involved in the waste
management programme, since that would
ensure the school’s full support.
However,
this is unlikely, since the principal is generally
too busy to be involved in each school
initiative on a day-to-day basis.
The waste committee should thus set up
regular update sessions with the school
principal, to keep him/her informed about
how the initiative is progressing, the
success the programme has had, what the
committee has planned next, and what
The objective of these sessions would be to get
the principal’s support in implementing new
waste management ideas, and addressing
some of the problems or hindrances.
Having the complete support of the school’s
principal is crucial to the ultimate success
of the programme. (See the section on key
Representatives from the teaching committee
or three other educator representatives.
11
Learner representation
Having learners on the waste committee
is vital, since they will assist in generating
awareness and support amongst their peers.
One idea is for the student body to vote for
their own learner representatives.
Another
option is to elect learners on a rotating basis,
so that multiple learners can have a chance
to be involved and learn about the processes
behind the waste management programme.
Representation from the
school’s cleaning staff
Although learners, educators and parents
can do a great deal to ensure the success
of the programme, the school’s caretaker
and cleaning staff also need to support the
ideas and processes if the initiative is to be
a success. It is thus recommended that they
also be involved in the waste committee.
An idea would be to invite them to
participate in key planning sessions, or to
hold regular sessions to bring them up to
date on how the programme is doing, the
role they are playing in making it a success,
and how they could further assist in helping
the programme to succeed.
Now that your waste committee has been
established, you can move on to conducting
your waste audit.
coNDuctiNG a Waste auDit
To find out how much and what type of
waste your school currently throws away,
your waste committee will need to obtain
the necessary permission and support to
plan and conduct a complete waste audit.
This audit will give you answers to the
following questions:
• Where does your school produce
most of its waste? Schools produce
waste in classrooms, offices, dining halls,
computer rooms, bathrooms and on the
playground. Finding out where certain
types of waste are produced in your
school, will help you to position your
recycling points effectively.
• What types of waste are produced?
Some of the more common waste types
produced by schools include paper and
cardboard, paper towels, food, milk
cartons, cold-drink cans and plastic
packaging.
Understanding what types of
waste materials your school produces will
help you to decide which of the waste
streams your recycling centre should focus
on. • How much waste does your school
produce? Knowing roughly how much
of each waste type your school produces
will help you to plan what size bins your
recycling centre will need.
You can also
use that information to measure whether
your school’s recycling efforts have
reduced the amount of waste you are
throwing away.
Here are some guidelines on how to
conduct your school’s waste audit:
A. Materials
You will need the following:
• Bagged rubbish
• Old carrier bags (eight for each group
involved in the audit)
• 10–20 large bin bags
• Spring balances or newton meters
• Ground sheets/floor covers
• Clipboards with copies of the recording
sheet
• Rubber gloves for everyone involved
• Overalls or old clothing
B. Preparation
• Pick an average school day on which you
will audit your school’s waste.
Let all the
staff know when the audit will take place.
• Carry out a risk assessment – consider
what the dangers associated with the
audit might be, and put measures in place
to minimise them.
the children to wear on the day, and
possibly to request the assistance of adult
volunteers.
• Ask the school’s caretaker to save one
day’s waste from the entire school,
including non-teaching areas such as
bathrooms, staff rooms, offices and the
playground.
• Ask the caretaker to look through the
bags, remove sharp objects, and label
each bag with the area of the school it
came from (for example, classroom 1,
playground, etc.).
Ensure that bags of
food waste are clearly labelled and kept
separately.
Store all bags of waste safely
overnight.
C. The audit
• Clearly explain all the health and safety
issues to the learners involved in the
audit.
Gloves should be worn at all times,
and learners should call an adult if they
see any sharp objects in the rubbish.
• Weigh all bags containing discarded
food, and capture the results in grams on
the recording sheet.
Once you are done,
you can dispose of the waste in the usual manner.
• Divide the learners involved in the audit
into three to four groups.
should have a ground sheet to work on,
a recording sheet and pencil, and a set of
spring balances or newton meters.
• Get each group to empty the bags of
rubbish – one at a time – onto the plastic
mat, and sort it into the different types
of waste shown on the recording sheet
• You may want to send a letter to the
• Groups should have a separate carrier bag
ask them to provide old clothing for for each waste type.
They will sort the
waste into these bags, and weigh them
13
using an appropriate spring balance or
newton meter, before logging the results
on the recording sheet.
• Once the contents of the carrier bags
in each group have been weighed and
recorded, empty them into larger bin bags
and reuse the carrier bag.
• When all bags have been sorted and
the data have been recorded, dispose of
the waste and recyclables in the usual
manner.
D. The follow-up
• The next step is to calculate the daily,
weekly and yearly waste totals for the
school.
Multiply the daily totals by five
for the weekly results, and the weekly
totals by 38 (the average number of
weeks spent at school per year) for the
yearly results.
Work out the percentage of
different types of waste produced.
• Compare waste data from different areas
around your school to identify the waste
'hot spots' (places where most of the waste is being generated).
• Discuss your findings: What are the most
common types of waste?
Is any of it
recyclable?
Which type of waste would
make the biggest difference if recycled?
• This is the information you will use in
planning how to REDUCE, REUSE AND
RECYCLE your school’s waste.
• Present your findings to the rest of the
school through an assembly or newsletter.

reDuciNG the Waste the school
creates
The best way to solve the waste problem
in Cape Town is to reduce the amount of waste we produce.
Depending on the
outcome of your waste audit, your school
should try and focus on the waste stream(s)
you are producing the most of. Here are
some tips on how to reduce the waste you generate:
• Avoid buying products with excessive
packaging.
• Reduce packaging by buying the items
you use frequently in bulk, and by
purchasing refills and concentrates.
• Try to buy products with packaging that is
made from recycled materials.
• Try not to buy disposable products, such
as disposable razors or paper plates.
• Choose glass over plastic, as it can always
be recycled.
Many plastic packaging items
are still not recyclable in South Africa.
• Avoid all toxic and hazardous products.
For example, try to use organic cleaning
products in your school and at home.
They are safer for you and for the
environment.
Idea!
Why not allocate a waste generation
area to each of the classes in your school,
and ask the learners to come up with
clever ways to reduce the amount of waste
being produced.
Implement the viable
ideas, and track the effect it has on the
school’s waste generation.
Award the class
whose recommendations have the biggest
impact on the volume of waste the school
produces.
reusiNG the Waste the school
creates One of the most important things for a
waste warrior to remember is that waste is
not waste until it is wasted!
Finding clever
and effective ways to reuse waste will save
your school money, help your school to
make money, and help to cut down on the
volumes of rubbish being sent to landfills.
Here are some handy tips to help your school
reuse the waste that it is generating:
• Before disposing of something you no
longer need, try to think of other ways
in which your school could use it.
For
example, discarded paper could be used
to make papier-mâché; discarded cans
could be used in your arts and crafts class;
glass jars could be used to hold crayons
or pencils in the classroom, etc.
Once
you have identified ways to reuse certain
waste streams, ask the learners to bring
that kind of waste to school from home,
thereby reusing waste that is generated in
households as well.
• Look outside of your school for people
who may want to reuse the waste you
are producing.
For example, some artists
use recycled waste to produce their art.
You may even be able to sell your waste
to external parties, thereby making some
money for your school.
• Where possible, repair items that are
broken.
Support the local seamstress and
carpenter.
This will reduce waste as well
as stimulate employment, growth and
development in your community.
• Avoid using non-recyclable materials,
such as cling wrap or tinfoil, around your
school.
• When it comes to organic waste such
as leftover food stuffs, create compost.
There are different ways to make
compost, so select one that suits your
consider using the compost for a small
Setting up a school recycling programme
sell the vegetables to members of your
community, and in so doing, generate
additional income.
• Other possible products that can be
produced from organic waste are organic
fertilizers or worm tea.
Chat to your
local nursery to see whether they have a
demand for these sorts of products, and
ask the experts there for some advice
about producing them.
Based on your audit, allocate a waste
stream to each class in your school, and task
them with coming up with different possible
ways to reuse that waste.
Ask each class to
produce a project showcasing the ideas they
have come up with, and put these projects on display around the school.
Implement the
viable ideas at school.
settiNG up the school
recycliNG ceNtre
Having carefully looked at what waste the
school is creating, ways to reduce that
waste, and ways to reuse the materials
before they are wasted, the final step in the
move towards effective waste management
is to set up the school’s recycling centre.
Recycling refers to the separation of
recyclable waste from the general waste
stream, the processing of these materials, and
their reuse.
Recycling not only saves resources,
but it also reduces the environmental impact
of manufacturing new products, and the
impact of waste at landfills.
Many successful recycling businesses
have been set up in South Africa, for
example, Collect-a-Can and the Glass
Recycling Company.
These businesses offer
employment opportunities to a large number
of people from the surrounding communities
and, in so doing, contribute to growth and
development in our country.
Let’s take a look at the different aspects of
setting up a recycling centre at your school.
What will your centre recycle?
To decide which of the waste streams your
recycling centre will work with, you should
consider the results from your waste audit.
The success of your centre will, to a large
extent, depend on the access you have to
the various waste streams.
If, for example,
your audit showed that your school does not
throw away much glass, then you will need
to either leave glass out of your recycling
plans, or depend on outside sources to bring
glass into the centre.
Here are some ways to make sure that you
are benefiting from all the waste that is
being generated at school:
Internal recycling points
• Make recycling easy by positioning
recycling points as close to the source
of waste as possible, for example, place
a paper recycling bin next to the photo
copier/printer.
• Label recycling points clearly, so that
everyone knows where they are, and
what they are for.
• Put recycling points and normal rubbish
bins next to each other.
• You may be provided with internal
recycling containers by your collectors,
or you can use data from your waste audit
to help you decide what type, size and
quantity of recycling bins will best suit the
• Decide who will be tasked with emptying
delivering waste to the recycling centres.
Setting up a school recycling programme
Learners could, for example, get involved
on a rotational basis.
Think about any
equipment that learners or other 'internal
collectors' will need, and how often you
would want them to collect.
External sources of waste
Looking to external sources of waste is
definitely recommended for a school
recycling centre.
Here are some possible
outside sources that you could consider
across all waste streams:
• Learners’ homes (for organic waste,
plastics, glass, cans and paper)
• Restaurants near your school (specifically
for glass and cans, and perhaps also for
organic waste)
considered.
Although access to more waste
will certainly enable you to generate more
revenue, you need to be sure that the costs
of getting the waste to your recycling centre
do not exceed the benefits.
• Retail outlets near your school (specifically
for cardboard boxes that merchandise is
delivered in)
• Businesses that operate near your school
(for the supply of high-quality white
paper, etc.)
• Other schools close to your school
that have not implemented their own
recycling programme, and that are
happy to supply waste from their school
and from their learners’ households to your centre
The distance between your school’s centre
and the various waste sources, as well as
how you will get the waste from those
sources to your centre, needs to be carefully
Who will collect your waste?
Once you know which waste streams your
centre will recycle, you need to choose your
collectors, and make arrangements with them.
Here are some things to consider
when making your decision:
• TYPES – Look at what type of waste
each collector will pick up. This is
especially important when it comes to
plastics, as they all melt at different
temperatures, and collectors tend to
recycle only one type of plastic.
This has implications for sorting,
as you need to know which plastics
need to be separated from one another
during the sorting process.
• PRICE – Which collectors will give you
the best price for the waste that you have
collected and sorted?
The more you sort
your waste, the better the prices you will
be able to secure.
For example, you are
likely to get less for paper if you send
all your paper products – newspapers,
magazines, white paper (office paper)
– to the same recycler, than you will get
if you sell specific products to specific
collectors or customers.
You could, for
example, sell good quality magazines to
second-hand bookstores or high-quality
white paper to Mondi.
The price that you can secure for the
different waste streams will vary depending
on the collector you are dealing with,
and the level to which you sort your waste.
For example, you can usually get 15c per
kilogram of recycled paper, but if you
separate the white office paper from the
other paper products, and sell that, you can
secure up to 45c per kilogram.
Waste stream Plastics – depends on the company you are dealing with and the
level of sorting you are prepared to do, for example, removing
caps and lids
Glass Cans
Paper – as above, depends on the level to which you are prepared
to sort your paper products (varies from company to company)
Example price
Between 85c and R1,20 per kilo
for PET 1, 2 PE-HD, 5PP
13c per kilo
33c per kilo
Approx 15c per kilo for mixed
paper, 45c per kilo for white
office paper
• VOLUMES – What quantity of waste
do collectors/recyclers require you to
have before they are prepared to pick
it up?
Consider the implications in
terms of the amount of storage space
you have available in your centre – for
example, smaller centres should work
with collectors that are happy to pick up
smaller quantities of waste.
Most plastic
collectors tend to want you to have five
to six bale bags available before they will
collect.
Glass, paper and can recyclers
would prefer to collect once your
containers are full.
What infrastructure do you need?
Once you have decided on the waste
streams that you will recycle, you need to
consider the infrastructure requirements
associated with setting up your centre.
Here
are some aspects you need to consider:
Location – where will your
centre be based?
• SPACE: Your recycling centre will need
sufficient space for you to accommodate,
sort and store the waste that comes in.
Most collectors will only pick up once
you have reached sufficient volumes,
so you will need to be able to store
the sorted waste until you reach their volume benchmarks.
Setting up a school recycling programme
companies deliver to your site for paper,
glass and cans.
Taking all of these
requirements into account, the ideal
place will be at least as large as a double
garage. • ACCESS: Your centre must also be
accessible, so as to ensure easy delivery
of waste coming in from external sources,
as well as waste collection. The ideal
place will have a parking area big enough
to turn a small truck.
• HEALTH AND SAFETY: Because a
recycling centre processes and stores
waste materials, you need to pay careful
consideration to the health and safety
aspects.
From a health perspective,
consider the odour that the waste might
generate (especially if you are dealing
with organic waste and composting).
Also, think about the effect of insects
such as flies that may be attracted to
your centre. Ideally, your centre should
be placed away from high-traffic areas
within the school, and away from school
neighbours who may not be open to
having the centre located close to their
properties.
If paper is one of your waste
streams, you need to consider fire risks,
and put the relevant measures in place
– for example, no smoking on the site.
Also, make sure that you have a fire
staff know where it is and how to use it
in case of an emergency.
Bricks and mortar – what do
you require?
When considering the actual structure you
will need to have in place or build for your
recycling centre, consider the following:
• SIZE: As mentioned before, a space that
is at least as large as a double garage is
recommended.
• PROTECTION FROM THE ELEMENTS:
Your centre should offer the people
working there as well as the waste (that
has been delivered, is being sorted, or is
being stored) protection from heat, rain
and wind.
A structure that contains four
walls, a roof, a window (to let in light and
fresh air when required) and large double
doors (that big bale bags can easily fit
through) is recommended.
Extra height is also advantageous, as it
will enable you to store waste, such as
bale bags, on top of one another.
• SECURITY: To prevent vandalism and
minimise the risk of your sorted waste
being stolen, you need to be able to
secure your recycling centre when it is
not being manned.
The structure itself
should be lockable, and you should have
a fence with a lockable gate around the
perimeter. • WATER AND ELECTRICITY: You will
need access to water to ensure the staff
can wash their hands after working with
the waste.
Electricity will allow you to
keep a light on at night, which will assist
with security. Electricity is also important
for running the office. • OFFICE SPACE: Your centre will need
easy access to a telephone, and ideally,
a fax machine and e-mail facility.
This will
help you to set up initial agreements with
waste suppliers and collectors, and to
notify collectors once your waste is ready
to be collected.

waste management and the role it plays
in protecting the environment, which you
can put up for display around the centre?
This will also increase the learners’ level of
personal involvement in the centre.
Safety – what measures should
you put in place to minimise risk?
• VEHICLES: From a safety perspective,
consider the vehicles coming to and from
the centre, and make sure that learners
and people working in the centre are not
at risk.
• PROTECTIVE CLOTHING: Make sure that
all the centre’s staff and volunteers wear
gloves and possibly even plastic jackets
or overalls when they are sorting through
waste.
This will protect them from any
possible contamination.
• SHARP OBJECTS OR HAZARDOUS
WASTE: Make sure that sorters are
always on the lookout for sharp objects,
and that they can easily identify and deal
with hazardous waste that may have been
delivered to the centre by mistake.
Waste equipment – what will
you need?
• SORTING TABLES: You will require a
sufficient number of sorting tables to
handle the volume of waste that comes
into your centre.
Tables should be easily
accessible, and should have sufficient
space around them.
Consider labelling
tables so that new members of staff can
quickly catch on in terms of where each
of the waste streams should be sorted.
• BALE BAGS FOR PLASTICS: You will
need containers to manage each of your
waste streams.
For plastics, you will need
bale bags and ideally, stands on which
those bags can be hung.
These stands
support the bags, and make sure that they
stay open, which makes it easier to drop
sorted waste into them, and to check that
the same plastic types are being stored
together. Make sure that your bale bags
are clearly labelled (e.g. PET 1 or PET 4) to
assist sorters with where to place which
plastics, and to make sure that collectors
pick up the right bags when they come to
the centre.
• CONTAINERS: Your recycler will drop off
the necessary containers for glass, cans
and paper.
If required, label them to assist
sorters.
• WHEELIE BINS: You will also need one or
dispose of non-recyclable waste that might
have been sent to the centre by mistake.
Idea!
Why not liven up your recycling
centre by asking pupils at the school
to create posters based on the idea of
22
Idea!
Teach learners and the centre’s staff
about hazardous waste and the more
environmentally friendly options that can
replace hazardous cleaning products.
Ask learners to create artwork (posters/
murals) that showcase hazardous waste
products, and include information on how
to safely dispose of such products. Display
this artwork around the recycling centre
to ensure that all sorters are aware of
what to look out for, and how to deal with
hazardous waste should they come across it. staffing your centre
Take into consideration that your centre
may be staffed by several different groups
of people on an ongoing basis. Ensure that
the processes that need to be followed are
clearly laid out in order to guarantee that the
centre always runs efficiently, whoever
is staffing it.
When it comes to staffing your centre,
think about the volume of waste that will
be coming into the centre each week to
determine how many people you will need
to sort it.
Should your centre not have
financial resources to hire staff to run it, you
will need to work on a volunteer basis. Ask
the school’s Parents’ Association to assist
you in finding parents who are able to help.
You could also consider this as an
opportunity to uplift unemployed members
of your community by offering them jobs at
the recycling centre.
This will obviously affect
the profit you are able to generate, but the
social responsibility aspect may help you to
generate financial sponsorship from local
businesses.
Finances In addition to helping to combat the waste
crisis in Cape Town, a well-run recycling
centre is also likely to generate some revenue
for the school.
You will need to work out
how this money will be handled.
You should also think about how the money
that the centre is generating will be used.
Are there specific projects that the school
needs to raise funds for, or can the profits be
used to enhance the recycling operation by
hiring a manager, purchasing a bakkie, etc?
GeNeratiNG aWareNess aND
loNG-term sustaiNability
The long-term success of the school’s waste
management programme will depend on the
initial awareness and understanding that you
create, and the long-term commitment to
making it work. Here are some tips to help
you in terms of launching the programme,
educating people about how it will work,
and keeping the programme going.
Generating awareness
In general
• Recycling should be seen as fun and easy.
Think about organising an exciting launch
event that will involve the entire school,
parents, leading members of the local
community, businesses (who have
already offered to support the initiative,
or who you would like to approach for
support), and the local media.
Among staff
• Hold an introductory meeting with all
staff members, including the cleaning
staff.
Explain why the school would like
to implement a waste management
system, and how the recycling system will
work.
Communicate the role everyone
needs to play in ensuring the initiative is
a success.
• Run a staff waste management training
session.
Make sure that all members of
staff understand the process – from the
initial waste audit, through to organising
external and internal recycling collections,
and determining the roles of individual
staff members.
• Create a calendar displaying key dates and
• Run follow-up training sessions in
order to give staff ideas about how to
include waste management topics in the curriculum.
milestones for the programme. Place the
calendar, together with information about
the programme, on staff notice boards.
Among learners
• Get the learners that are members of the
waste management committee to present
the waste management plan during
assembly.
Think of ways to make the
presentation fun, exciting and interactive.
• Give fortnightly updates during assembly
to inform learners about how the
programme is progressing.
Showcase
key milestones and successes on notice
boards and the school’s website.
• Think about organising social activities
based on waste management, such as
community cleanup days where learners
go out into the community and help to
collect litter.
• Give learners branded bibs or hats to
wear on the days that they are collecting
waste from school recycling points.
• Arrange a visit from a member of your
local authority’s waste management
department. Among parents
• Follow up the launch event by sending
home a 'How to Recycle' guide for all
parents.
This guide should clearly outline what parents can and cannot send to
the school’s recycling centre, as well as
the way in which recyclables should be
delivered – for example, washed and rid
of all excess water, etc.
• Ask the Parents Association to include the
waste management programme as an item on the agenda of their meetings.
• Include a regular waste management
update about any achievements and new initiatives that are being planned in the
school’s newsletter.
• Ask parents who might have ideas
about how to improve the programme or generate sponsorship money for
the initiative to contact the waste
management committee.
Keeping it going!
Getting a school programme started is one
thing; keeping it going is a much harder
task.
The following section gives some tips
and practical advice about how to ensure the
sustainability of the programme you put in place:
• Make sure that you have a member of
staff as a waste champion – someone
who has accepted responsibility for
keeping the momentum going and
moving the programme forward. Ensure
that the waste champion continually
monitors the scheme, and provides
feedback to the waste committee. The
waste champion must also keep the head
educator as well as the rest of the staff
up to date regarding the programme’s
progress and upcoming initiatives.
• Put measures in place to ensure regular
updates from the people who manage
the recycling centre.
They will have a
clear idea of the volume of waste that
is coming in and how it is changing.
If it
starts to decrease, they will be able to
alert you so that you can put measures
in place to remotivate learners, parents,
staff and cleaners.
Centre staff can also
alert you to any problems the programme
might be experiencing.
• If the level of involvement and
commitment drops off, ask educators to
include waste management related topics
in their lesson plans.
Consider field trips
to give learners a first-hand view of a
landfill, or bringing in an expert to talk to
learners about waste and the impact it
has on the environment.
• Reward the school when the programme
works well – everyone likes recognition
for success.
Talk to the local media
about the programme and what it has
achieved to see if you can secure press
coverage.
Set up rewards for waste
management champions – the class that
comes up with the best way to reuse waste, or the class that produces the
best waste awareness posters for the
school recycling centre. Also, look out
for any national or regional awards and
competitions that your school could
enter.
• Finally, consider succession planning.
To make sure that the waste management
programme does not falter when the
elected waste champion(s) leave the
school, put some succession planning
tactics in place.
For example, there will
always be a Parents Association, so
give them the task of electing the two
parents who will serve on the waste
management committee each year; or
make sure that the head educator elects
a waste champion from within the staff
complement on an annual basis, and
that running the waste management
programme is part of that educator’s
job description for the year.
critical Factors For success
Throughout the booklet, we have discussed
a number of factors that are central to your
school being able to set up and run a waste
management programme. Here is a summary
of all the boxes you need to tick to ensure
• People to champion the cause – Make
sure you always have a waste champion

• Recycling facilities – Having the right
infrastructure and equipment in place is
crucial. You need a secure, contained and
recycling operation.
It must be secured during non-school hours, to prevent
illegal dumping, and prevent people
from stealing waste that has already
been sorted.
You also need well-

YOUR A TO Z DICTIONARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL WORDS
How to use this Dictionary
• This dictionary is an A to Z list of important environmental words to help you read and understand more
about our environment.
• Look up the word you need in the A to Z dictionary.
Let’s say you want to check on the meaning of
“environmental policy”.
Look under the letter “E”.
Example under “E”:
Environmental policy
Guidelines and rules for managing and protecting the environment.
• When explaining a word, we sometimes use words in italic letters.
These words in italic letters are also
in the dictionary - so you can look the word up if you are not sure of its meaning.
Example under “C”:
Conservation
Protecting, using and saving resources wisely.
Now you can look up “Resources” under the letter “R”.
• Also, when you see this sign >> you will be asked to look somewhere else in the A to Z dictionary.
Example:

INTRODUCTION, STRUCTURE AND CONTEXT
The City of Cape Town administers a coastline of approximately 260km, making it the largest
coastal metro in South Africa in terms of sea frontage.
The sustainable and integrated
management of this coastline is facilitated through the development of various frameworks
and regulatory mechanisms as required in the National Environmental Management:
Integrated Coastal Management Act, Act 24 of 2008 (ICM Act).
One of these mechanisms
involves the obligatory development of a municipal coastal management programme to
manage the coastal zone or specific parts of the coastal zone.
In line with the requirements
of the ICM Act, and as a means to optimise the socio-economic and environmental
potential of Cape Town’s coastline, the City has recently completed a Coastal
Management Programme.
Structure of the City’s CMP
The City’s CMP has been structured as a single document comprising a number of individual
chapters that are dedicated to specific aspects of the overall management of the coastline.
This approach enables the amendment or addition of individual chapters as needed,
without having to review the entire document.
The City’s CMP follows a logical flow, and
chapters are arranged according to:
• policy and principles
•
institutional accountability and responsibility
legislative components
specific management and operational protocols.
Context of the City’s CMP
The City’s coastline is a unique, dynamic and diverse space, forming a nexus of
socioeconomic and environmental interactions.
The very nature of the City’s coastline
requires a management approach that is inclusive, transparent and draws in a range of
disciplines for its effective and integrated management.
The introduction of the CMP further
elaborates on the City’s coastline and management approach through the following
sections:
Section 4: Context
This section reflects on the importance of the coastline in terms of its contribution
towards a sense of place, social well-being, recreation and livelihood perspective.
Section 5: Economic context
This section discusses the importance of the City’s coastline to the wider economy,
tourism, property values, economic growth and risk reduction.
Section 6: Physical context
This section provides a description of the City’s coastline from a biophysical and
process perspective, including a description of upwelling events, rocky shores,
estuaries, dunes and sediment dynamics.
City of Cape Town’s Coastal Management Programme 2015
CHAPTER 1: COASTAL ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Cape Town’s coastline is one if its greatest economic, social and environmental assets that
contributes significantly to the City’s tourism, recreation and industry sectors.
Effective
management of the coastline is therefore important for retaining and optimising the value of
the coast.
Chapter 1 of the full CMP defines the roles and responsibilities of various line
departments and stakeholders as means to promote an integrated management approach
of the coast and its resources.
Several principles guide the City’s position towards defining and identifying coastal roles and
responsibilities, including:
purpose of that space.
The coastline is a shared responsibility and support from the relevant line departments
to the lead department is critical.
• Roles and responsibilities should be assigned wherever possible according to the key
functional responsibility, mandate and capacity of City’s departments.
• Ongoing communication and coordination between departments must be
entrenched through the establishment of a quarterly coastal coordination meeting.
Chapter 1 of the full CMP elaborates on these core principles and provides a detailed and
extensive breakdown of coastal functions per line department.
Defining coastal responsibilities and assigning them to the relevant line departments is central
to achieving effective and appropriate integrated coastal management in the City of Cape
Town.
CHAPTER 2: INTEGRATED COASTAL MANAGEMENT POLICY
The City’s coastline is an important economic, social and environmental asset which provides us
with numerous benefits and opportunities.
These goods and services are key contributors to
Cape Town’s economy, desirability and global recognition as one of the world’s most beautiful
cities. Effective policy is central to good governance, long-term planning and optimising the
sustainable opportunities along our coastline.
This Integrated Coastal Management Policy is
therefore essential for reducing risk to the City and its communities, and is central to retaining
and enhancing the current and future economic, social and environmental opportunities of our
unique coastline.The principles determined in the Integrated Coastal Management Policy both
complement and support the principles defined in the National Environmental Management:
Integrated Coastal Management Act (ICM Act).
These principles will be applied to all City
coastal decision making, and include the following:
• Equitable and ease of public access to coastal areas and opportunities for the entire
coastline.
• City decisions regarding the coastline will include broad-based stakeholder engagement
and public consultation processes.
• Economic and social development opportunities will be optimised to the benefit of all residents.
• Development must not degrade the coastal environment or reduce its ability to cope with climate change risks.
• Natural heritage resources must be protected for future generations.
Strategic decisions will be made and measures implemented in order to reduce coastal
risk from climate change effects.
• All individuals must be responsible for their actions and avoid causing any negative
impact on the coastal environment.
A set of implementation regulations, mechanisms and tools – which together constitute the
City’s Integrated Coastal Management Framework – will be developed to protect and manage
Cape Town’s coast and to give effect to these policy principles.
These include the Coastal
Overlay Zone, Coastal By-law, Coastal Economic and Spatial Development Plan and Coastal
Operational Management Protocols. These are discussed in separate chapters of the City’s
CMP.
Chapter 2 of the full CMP is structured in the following manner:

CHAPTER 3: COASTAL LAND POLICY: PURCHASE AND LEASING
The Coastal Land Policy reflects the City’s clear intent to ensure that the coastline is
managed, maintained and kept as a common asset that is accessible to all.
This has been
enabled through the implementation of a Coastal Urban Edge as part of the City’s Spatial
Development Framework, which guides land use decisions and development along the
coastline.
The Coastal Land Policy ensures consistency and transparency in decision making
along the coastline, by addressing:
the acquisition of private land seaward of the Coastal Urban Edge
the preferred cessation of City-owned land seaward of the Coastal Urban Edge
• •
• agreements with other government departments who administer land seaward of the
Coastal Urban Edge
lease agreements with private individuals, organisations or commercial entities
the consolidation of state-owned coastal land.
• •
The Coastal Land Policy directives outline the City’s stance on the management of land that
is situated seaward of the Coastal Urban Edge and any decisions with regard to this land.
These policy directives address the following:
Acquisition of private land in the coastal environment
This directive outlines the circumstances and conditions under which the City may
consider purchasing private land in the coastal environment.
Alienation of city-owned land
The policy clearly states that no city-owned or administered land seaward of the
Coastal Urban Edge must be alienated or sold, except where such land is required for
strategic purposes of national or regional importance.
This directive outlines the
circumstances under which the City may consider alienating such land.
Leasing of City-owned land
This directive outlines the circumstances and conditions under which the City may
lease out land or infrastructure that is situated seaward of the Coastal Urban Edge, as
well as conditions pertaining to current lease agreements.
Coastal land administered by other state departments
A large proportion of land that is seaward of the Coastal Urban Edge is administered
by other organs of state.
This directive outlines the City’s management stance on
such land.
CHAPTER 4: COASTAL SET-BACK DELINEATION: METHOD AND PROCESS
While the City’s coastline offers significant socioeconomic potential, paradoxically the coastline
may also become a source of risk to the City.
Approximately 25 km² in Cape Town is at high risk
to sea-level rise and storm surges over the next 25 years.
Presented with this risk, and without a
strategic decision support framework to promote risk averse decision making with regard to
coastal development, the City has developed a Coastal Urban Edge.
This Coastal Urban Edge is
formally represented in the City’s Spatial Development Framework and doubles as the City’s
draft coastal set-back line in terms of the Integrated Coastal Management Act, Act 24 of 2008
(ICM Act).
The method used to define the City’s Coastal Urban Edge has successfully merged
both socio-institutional and biological responses, thereby combining the merits of both, into a
spatial planning mechanism for the City’s coastline.
Chapter 4 of the full CMP represents the City’s formal submission to the Western Cape
Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (DEA&DP) to formalise the
City’s Coastal Urban Edge as the set-back line in terms of the ICM Act.
This chapter details the
City’s method and process in delineating its draft coastal set-back line.
The City has identified
five key objectives of its draft coastal set-back line, which include:
the promotion of access to the coast
retention of private property rights
the promotion of increased degrees of integrated coastal management across multiple
line departments within the City
to ensure that the socioeconomic opportunities that the coast currently provides are
retained and enhanced into the future
to ensure the conservation of remaining functional coastal ecosystems.
information and knowledge relating to:
the promotion of access to the coast the exclusion of private property with development rights
sea-level rise, storm surges and coastal erosion
• coastal dynamic processes
scenic drives, aesthetics and sense of place
the City’s biodiversity network.
Without a coastal set-back line, risk to the City and its residents will increase in the future.
The City
emphasises the fact that this risk is not limited to physical damage that may arise from coastal
dynamic processes or storm surges, but that risk created from inappropriate decision making will
manifest in a variety of broader environmental and socioeconomic forms.
CHAPTER 5: CITY OF CAPE TOWN COASTAL BY-LAW
A key chapter in the CMP is the proposed Coastal By-law.
Due to the legal implications
associated with adopting a by-law and for the purposes of public engagement in line with
the City’s Public Participation Guidelines, this chapter will be finalised through a separate
process and only referenced as a future chapter in this public engagement process.
CHAPTER 6: COASTAL SPATIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR THE CITY’S COAST
The City’s Coastal Spatial and Economic Development Plan (CSEDP) outlines the City’s drive to
increase investment in its coastline.
This will be done by identifying and promoting the coastline’s
untapped social and economic opportunities, through appropriate and sensitive development.
Since the late 1980s, local government has invested very little in the coastline and many of the
current facilities are outdated and dilapidated, while few new opportunities have been
created. The CSEDP therefore aims to:
identify public development and private sector opportunities
identify appropriate integration opportunities
integrate coastal resort development plans
• assess the coast both economically and spatially as a single, connected space •
• • • assess marine development opportunities
• develop an approach to integrate the three fishing harbours into the City’s economy
• •
• assess the potential for formalising the marine and coastal eco-tourism industry •
• assess opportunities for the development of new small boat harbours •
identify coastal infrastructure that the City should no longer invest in, and remove it if
necessary. identify new public access opportunities
link public transport plans to beach and amenity nodal development
review the potential of the yacht and boat-building industry
The City’s CSEDP will be led by the Spatial Planning and Urban Design Department and
supported and integrated across a number of the City’s line departments.
It is expected that the
development of the CSEDP will commence in the 2014/2015 financial year and be completed
within 24 months.
Chapter 6 of the full CMP furthermore outlines the costs to the City of poor coastal
development, the objectives of the City’s CSEDP and the expected outcomes of this plan.
CHAPTER 7: CITY OF CAPE TOWN ZONING SCHEME: GENERAL COASTAL OVERLAY ZONE
The City of Cape Town’s General Coastal Overlay Zone provides specific land use requirements
and regulations between the high water mark (as defined in the ICM Act) and the Coastal
Urban Edge (as defined in the City of Cape Town’s Spatial Development Framework).
The City
will apply general provisions and regulations to all land use activities between this high water
mark and the Coastal Urban Edge.
Additional local area overlay zones may be developed and
applied to specific areas, as well as to areas landward of the Coastal Urban Edge where risk to
storm surges may be present.
The General Coastal Overlay Zone chapter in the full CMP is structured according to the
following sections:
Section 2: General provisions
This section discusses the requirements for various authorisations and plans in connection
with any development to which the Coastal Overlay Zone is applicable.
It also discusses
activities that may be exempt from approval.
Section 3: Coastal hazard provisions
This section lists the provisions that the City can apply to a coastal hazard area in terms of
the General Coastal Overlay Zone.
This section also discusses the conditions that may
necessitate additional studies to reduce risk in hazard areas.
Section 4: General conditions
This section lists the general conditions for development within the Coastal Overlay Zone.
CHAPTER 8: COASTAL ACCESS LAND
The City of Cape Town recognises the importance of promoting equitable, safe and
environmentally sensitive access to the coastline for all abled and disabled citizens to enjoy, and
as a means to further enhance the socio-economic value of our coastline. Equitable access to
the coastline is particularly important given South Africa’s history of exclusion and discrimination
under the apartheid regime. This socioeconomic need to promote coastal access, however,
needs to be conducted in an environmentally responsible manner that will not diminish the
value of our coastline.
Municipalities are required to both designate strips of coastal access land
and develop a Coastal Access Management Strategy according to the requirements of the
National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act, Act 24 of 2008,
(ICM Act).
The Coastal Access Land chapter of the full CMP provides an overview of the City’s
strategy for promoting equitable and ecologically sound access the coastline.
The City has identified two broad types of coastal access that will be promoted:
Macro-scale access
Macro-scale access refers to the promotion of broad-scale socioeconomic upliftment,
by connecting previously disadvantaged communities to the coast by means of nodal
growth points.
This involves the development of coastal resorts and amenities in strategically located
areas, in particular along the Cape Flats section of the False Bay coastline.
This is further
discussed in Annexure A of Chapter 8 of the full CMP.
Nodal growth will be promoted at
five strategically located sites across the City’s coastline, namely Silwerstroomstrand,
Strandfontein, Blue Waters, Mnandi and Monwabisi.
Micro-scale access
Micro-scale access refers to the promotion of safe and environmentally sensitive access
via designated coastal access routes.
These can take the form of cul-de-sacs, car parks,
boat launch sites, public roads and walkways.
This is further discussed in Annexure B of
the full CMP. The City has defined clear management objectives for micro-scale access along the City’s
coastline, which are to:
• Promote the enjoyment of the coastline on an equitable basis.
• Ensure that access to the coast provides an informative and educational experience.
• Ensure that access to the coastline is convenient.
• Minimise negative impacts on the sensitive coastal environment.
•
Safeguard against the encroachment of private property onto coastal access land.
The identification and development of macro-scale nodal growth points will be managed
through a broader strategic planning process and in accordance with the City’s Spatial
Development Framework.
CHAPTER 9: COASTAL DEVELOPMENT NODES
The City is committed to optimising coastal opportunities for all its communities and, where
possible, restoring equity in coastal land ownership.
This will be done by prioritising coastal
nodal development that will connect previously disadvantaged communities to the
coastline whereby such development nodes will be used as a conduit for socioeconomic
upliftment.
This development is mindful of the City’s apartheid planning legacy, which restricted
opportunities for many ethnic groups regarding the ownership of land in close proximity to
the coastline.
Environmental factors also need to be considered, particularly for
development that is associated with residential or recreational objectives.
The City has identified five suitable coastal development nodes that meet both social and
environmental factors.
Four of these development nodes are located along the False Bay
coastline and will link the communities of Strandfontein, Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha to the
coastline.
The fifth proposed nodal development point is located on the West Coast and will
act as a linkage corridor for the community of Atlantis.
Specifically, these development nodes will be located at:
• Monwabisi
• Mnandi
• Blue Waters
Strandfontein
Silwerstroomstrand
A rapid planning review was undertaken with the intent to:
• Develop a concise synthesis of current strategy and policy imperatives that inform
• developments along the coast.
Identify key developmental challenges and opportunities experienced within the
study area.
• Define zones of development opportunity along the relevant section of the False Bay
• coastline.
Identify a set of guiding principles that should inform any development proposals
along this stretch of coastline.
• Undertake a detailed analysis of the local physical informants to development at
identified zones of opportunity.
Chapter 9 of the full CMP elaborates further on the context, constraints and priorities
regarding the five development nodes and provides an aerial image for each of the
development sites.
CHAPTER 10: COASTAL AND SEA DEFENCE DECISION FRAMEWORK
Much of the City of Cape Town’s extensive coastline has been developed with fixed
infrastructure, thereby significantly restricting natural coastal processes from taking place
unhindered.
This coastal change may be caused by either erosion or accretion processes, as
well as through climate change effects.
These climate change effects are manifested through
an increase in mean sea level and an increase in the intensity and frequency of coastal storms.
The City will therefore need to consider the implementation of coastal and sea defenses in order
to protect vulnerable infrastructure.
Ill-informed decision making in responding to pressures
caused by coastal processes may exacerbate risk and also lead to the permanent loss of
existing beaches and coastal environments.
The City’s Coastal and Sea Defence Decision
Framework therefore provides considered guidance on the use of coastal and sea defenses so
that the most appropriate, risk averse decision may be made in the interest of the broader
community in the long term. The principles which guide this framework include:
risk averse decision making
• decisions centred on the common good
• application of multi-criteria assessment for decision making.
The City recognises three broad categories of coastal and sea defence options, including:
• engineered responses, i.e. sea walls
• ecosystem-based responses, i.e. use of dunes as buffers
socio-institutional responses, i.e. development of set-back lines.
The type of defence that the City chooses to implement will be guided by a multi-criteria
decision support framework.
This involves the analysis of options according to a certain set of
criteria in order to determine a multidisciplinary consensus on the most appropriate way forward.
A template of this multi-criteria assessment is provided in Chapter 10 of the full CMP.
The City’s Coastal and Sea Defence Framework is structured in the following manner:

CHAPTER 11: MARINE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY
Marine and coastal law enforcement within the City is currently the responsibility of national
government.
A lack of efficient policing in the marine environment, however, has resulted in
various social challenges along the City’s coastline including lawlessness, a negative public
perception of the authorities and a depletion of natural resources.
The City has therefore
developed a Marine and Environmental Law Enforcement Strategy to address these social
challenges within the marine environment.
This strategy, along with the development of a
specialised City Marine and Environmental Law Enforcement Unit, has received support from
the City’s Safety and Security Portfolio Committee.
Five key objectives are addressed in this strategy.
These objectives are further discussed in
Chapter 11 of the full CMP:
Strategic Objective 1
Develop a joint Cooperative Marine and Environmental Law Enforcement Strategy
between the City and relevant partners.
This strategy will focus on marine poaching,
legislative compliance and improved interagency cooperation.
Strategic Objective 2
Establish a specialised City Marine and Environmental Law Enforcement Unit, which
will be highly visible and will respond to any transgressions within the City’s jurisdiction.
Strategic Objective 3
Establish a coastal and marine hotline reporting number so that any transgressions or
issues can be reported and responded to.
Strategic Objective 4 Assess coastal infrastructure to determine any development requirements that may
improve marine law enforcement and social opportunities along the coastline.
Strategic Objective 5
Complete an assessment of regulatory coastal signage.
These strategic objectives will be achieved by addressing several focus areas, which include:
• an assessment of governing legislation
• clearly defined roles and responsibilities of the various City line departments and
partner organisations
• an assessment of current staff capacity within the existing Law Enforcement Section’s
Marine Unit and other relevant branches
• priority training interventions such as skippers licence training, life-saving and first aid.
The Environmental Resource Management Department will assist with the coordination and
support to the specialised City Marine and Environmental Law Enforcement Unit and will
assist in the collaboration with partner agencies.
The Law Enforcement and Specialised
Services branch will provide the financial and human resources as outlined in this strategy.
CHAPTER 12: COASTAL EMERGENCY PLANS
Cape Town has a highly dynamic, sensitive and rich coastal environment which contributes
significantly to the city’s economy.
The occurrence of a major oil spill or shipping incident will
therefore impact negatively upon the economic, environmental and social value of the
coastline.
The strategic position of Cape Town along key international shipping routes, in
combination with the city’s severe weather and sea conditions, means that the risk of shipping
incidents and strandings remains high. An integrated response to these disaster scenarios is
required because shipping incidents and oil spills occur across jurisdictional boundaries and
ecosystems and can therefore have a great impact on a wide range of stakeholders in the City
of Cape Town. Chapter 12 of the full CMP provides management plans for both shipping
disasters and coastal oil spills:
1.
Shipping Incident Disaster Risk Management Plan
Purpose
The purpose of the Shipping Incident Disaster Risk Management Plan is to outline the
organisation of activities in response to coastal disasters in Cape Town.
All hazards
related to shipping and maritime operations at sea adjacent to the municipal area of
the City are covered by this plan.
The plan makes provision for any major shipping
incident or any other type of emergency involving one or more vessels or maritime
structures that may affect the City’s community.
Content
The Shipping Incident Disaster Risk Management Plan includes information about the
major and supporting role-players involved in the management plan, risk information,
proactive disaster management efforts, a tactical response plan for a shipping
emergency, a classification of disasters and post-incident recovery aspects.
2.
Coastal Oil Spill Contingency Plan
The primary objective of the Coastal Oil Spill Contingency Plan is to minimise both
environmental damage and loss of time in carrying out the appropriate remedial action
during an oil spill.
This is achieved by stating the functions and responsibilities of the
various authorities involved, the infrastructure to be set up and the response required by
such authorities during the incident.
This plan covers the areas falling within Cape Town’s
jurisdiction, i.e. the area extending from Bokbaai in the north to Koeelbaai in the east.
Content
The Coastal Oil Spill Contingency Plan includes information about the responsible
authorities during an oil spill, financial arrangements and compensation, preparatory
activities, initial reporting on and the different types of response to an oil spill, available
facilities and job descriptions for personnel involved.
CHAPTER 13: LARGE MARINE ANIMAL STRANDING POLICY AND PROTOCOL
The City of Cape Town occasionally experiences strandings of large marine animals, which is
addressed in more detail of Chapter 13 of the full CMP.
This policy specifically addresses the
stranding of whales, dolphins, large sharks and seals.
The Large Marine Animal Stranding
Policy and Protocol defines the coordinated response by City line functions to these events,
details roles and responsibilities for each line function, organises decision-making processes
and defines how the City’s policy fits into the broader national Stranding Policy.
The City’s Large Marine Animal Stranding Policy and Protocol is guided by the following
principles, namely to:
• Ensure a coordinated response to stranding events by the City and other authorities.
• Optimise the possibility of successful rescues in live stranding events.
• Provide support services to decision makers.
• Minimise suffering and trauma to live animals.
• Endorse humane decisions during stranding events.
• Minimise trauma to the general public.
• Consider the wider environmental habitat for each stranding event.
• Enable research access and accession of biological material
• Remove the carcasses in an effective manner within an environmental framework.
• Dispose of carcasses in an appropriate and legally compliant manner.
The policy and protocol recognises and specifically addresses four different types of
strandings, which include:
Category 1: Live whale, dolphin or whale shark stranding
Category 2: Injured or sick seals or seal pups
Category 3: Large shark species, alive or dead
Category 4: Whale, dolphin or shark carcasses
Chapter 13 of the full CMP addresses the relevant topics in the following sections:
Section A: General policy principles
Section A describes the City’s line departments and the authorities to whom this
policy will apply and lists the policy and governance principles for all stranding
events.
Section B: Protocol for each stranding category
Section B describes the specific responsible authorities and the stranding procedure
for each of the four different stranding categories.
Section C: Public awareness and communication
Section C addresses the need to effectively communicate with the public during a
marine animal stranding to ensure the safety of both the public and the animal.
CHAPTER 14: COASTAL RISK REGISTER
Due to the extent of the City’s coastline and a historical lack of clarity regarding
departmental roles and responsibilities, the maintenance of public infrastructure along the
City’s coastline requires attention and action.
Deteriorating public infrastructure has both
cost and risk implications for the City and its citizens.
This is manifested through a loss in
amenity value of the coastline, increased risk to beach users and a loss of important green
infrastructure.
The City’s Coastal Risk Register will therefore be a record of public
infrastructure that is currently damaged or threatened in the coastal zone within the City’s
jurisdiction.
This information will be submitted to the relevant City line department for
remedial action, and to the City’s Disaster Risk Management Forum and relevant subcouncils to monitor.
The aim of the City’s Coastal Risk Register is to:
Track and monitor all risk along the coastline.
• • Assign clear departmental responsibility for remedial action and ensure that these
departments are aware of their responsibilities.
• Clearly define the remedial action. •
State whether there are appropriate legislative requirements regarding the remedial
action.
Track the resolution of the risk. •
• Highlight any ongoing risk that is not addressed at appropriate City forum or
committee meetings.
A standard template will be completed for each risk that is identified.
This risk will include all
scales of degradation, such as broken boardwalks, collapsing sea walls and extensive
coastal erosion.
The standard template forms part of Chapter 14 of the full CMP.
This
template contains the following information:
summary of risk
• date and location of risk
•
responsible department and person for remedial action
recommended remedial action level of priority
legislative requirements/standards applicable to the corrective action
The Coastal Risk Register aims to address current risk to the City.
Potential future risk, and
CHAPTER 15: MARINE ACCESS POINTS
The City’s coastline provides opportunities and benefits to a wide range of users and suitable
access to the marine environment is necessary for both recreational and commercial purposes.
The City has established several public launch sites and jetties along its coastline to enable
access to a variety of users.
The location and management of these marine access points are
guided by the following principles:
The public boat launch sites must be easily accessible to all communities.
• High-quality and well-managed public boat launch sites are essential.
The safety of users and adherence to environmental legislation is imperative.
Chapter 15 of the full CMP provides a list and a map of the City’s boat launch sites and jetties
and covers the following topics:
Environmental and operational management plans
An Environmental and Operational Management Plan (EOMP) is required for all formally
designated launch sites.
This plan outlines the minimum management requirements for
each site.
Current EOMPs are available as annexures in Chapter 15 of the full CMP.
Legal and policy considerations
National legislation requires that each public boat launch site is permitted by the
provincial MEC for the environment.
The City is required to produce an EOMP for each
launch site that is permitted.
The use of off-road vehicles
The use of vehicles in the coastal zone is regulated by the National Environmental
Management: Control of Vehicles in the Coastal Zone Regulations.
Off-road vehicle
permits may be required by those who wish to access the coastal environment for
harvesting and consumptive purposes.
Roles and responsibilities
Several local, provincial and national departments are responsible for managing and
controlling marine access along the City’s coastline.
Chapter 15 of the full CMP outlines
the responsibilities of these key role-players.
CHAPTER 16: COASTAL RECREATIONAL USE ZONES
The City of Cape Town administers approximately 240 km of coastline within a diverse and
populated urban environment.
Coastal recreation is essential to the livelihoods and well-being
of many of the City’s inhabitants, and the coastline therefore serves as an important social and
economic asset.
The diverse nature of the City’s coastline allows for many different types of
recreational activities.
Yet the increasing number of recreational users poses safety concerns to
the general public and could lead to potential conflict between the different user groups.
Recreational activities along the City’s coastline are therefore guided by the following principles:
The coastline is a common asset and control of recreation types will only be
implemented as necessary.
• Access to the coastline for recreational purposes must remain unrestricted and free
• Consideration and care towards other users must be entrenched in all user groups.
• Coastal recreation in all forms should be encouraged.
• Use zones must be provided for those activities that may present safety or nuisance
concerns to the general public.
• Coastal recreation is at the users’ own risk.
Chapter 16 of the full CMP indicates the restrictions and regulations of popular recreational
activities along the City’s coastline, which are addressed in the following sections:
Surfing and bodyboarding
Section 4.1:
Section 4.2: Stand up paddle boarding
Section 4.3: Kite surfing and windsurfing
Section 4.4: Kayaking and surfskiing
Section 4.5: General swimming
Section 4.6: General beach activities
Section 4.7: Recreational fishing

CHAPTER 17: SHARK SAFETY
Cape Town’s coastline provides an environment where both humans and marine mammals
interact in close proximity to one another.
This interaction presents us with many benefits – such
as a thriving tourism and recreation industry – yet it also creates certain risks to water users and to
the marine environment.
Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) occur naturally along
Cape Town’s coastline and are considered to be one of the major threats to recreational water
users. These sharks, however, play a key role in the surrounding marine ecosystem and the City
has therefore adopted several novel approaches to reduce the occurrence of negative human-shark interactions.
The City of Cape Town’s approach to shark safety is guided by the following principles:
Risk Reduction
An early warning system alerts beach users to the status of sharks within their vicinity, to
reduce the probability of a shark encounter.
Shark Conservation
The City is committed to the conservation of sharks along its coastline and will only
implement shark safety measures which do not have a negative impact on the marine
environment.
Research
Research about shark movement and behaviour enables the City to gain a greater
understanding of sharks so that more targeted shark safety programmes can be
implemented.
These principles are reflected in the various programmes and policies that have been adopted
by the City regarding shark safety.
This includes the Shark Spotting Programme, which is
responsible for providing safety information to beach users through strategically located
spotters, a flag system and applied research. The shark exclusion net at Fish Hoek beach is
another project that has successfully reduced the interaction between humans and sharks whilst
minimizing negative environmental impacts.
Chapter 17 of the full CMP elaborates on the following safety measures and protocols adopted
by the City with regard to shark safety:
Section 9:
Shark Spotting Programme
Protocol for Shark Spotters Flag System
Shark Exclusion Net
Beach Closures
Shark Attack Emergency Response
Communication
Roles and Responsibilities
CHAPTER 18: BLUE FLAG STRATEGY
The Blue Flag programme is an international award given to beaches and marinas that meet
excellence in the areas of safety, water quality, amenities and environmental standards.
South
Africa is the first country outside of Europe to win Blue Flag certification for its beaches.
Cape
Town currently has eight beaches and two harbours that have received Blue Flag status for the
2013/2014 season.
These include: Silwerstroomstrand, Clifton 4th Beach, Camps Bay, Llundudno,
Muizenberg, Strandfontein, Mnandi, Bikini Beach, Granger Bay Water Club and False Bay Yacht
Club.
The Blue Flag programme is managed by the Wildlife and Environment Society of South
Africa (WESSA), while numerous City line departments and authorities are responsible for
implementing the necessary management requirements.
The City’s vision and aims with this Blue Flag programme are to:
• Ensure close alignment with the criteria and visions of the international Blue Flag
programme.
• Promote and facilitate community involvement.
• Provide a safe and healthy environment.
• Ensure the protection of the natural coastal environment.
• Promote the City’s coastline and its beaches as a major tourist attraction.
• Promote the City’s coastline as an important contributor to its economic prosperity.
Chapter 18 of the full CMP further discusses the following subjects:
Features of a Blue Flag beach
Section 4 of Chapter 18 addresses the facilities, equipment and services that the City
aims to provide at Blue Flag beaches.
Section 5 of Chapter 18 details the responsibilities of all the specific line departments and
authorities in the management of Blue Flag beaches.
Beach selection process
Section 6 of Chapter 18 addresses the criteria that the City considers when selecting a
new beach for Blue Flag status.
These criteria depend on factors relating to spatial
distribution, water quality and strategic planning.
Operational performance monitoring
Section 7 of Chapter 18 lists the minimum standards required at all Blue Flag beaches,
and the control measures that the City implements in order to achieve these standards.
CHAPTER 19: TREK NETTING PROTOCOL
Due to increasing reports of conflict between trek netters and beach users, the City of Cape
Town has established a Trek Netting Protocol which aims to balance the needs of all beach
users.
This protocol was developed between the relevant City departments (Environmental
Resource Management; Law Enforcement; Sport, Recreation and Amenities), the trek netting
rights-holders, representatives from the Shark Spotting Programme and the Department of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF).
Trek netting (also known as beach seine netting) has been practised along the City’s
coastline for more than three centuries and forms an important component of our coastal
heritage.
It is also an important source of income and employment for permitted operators.
These permits are determined and administered by DAFF; the City of Cape Town has no role
to play in the allocation of trek netting rights. The aim of the City’s Trek Netting Protocol is to:
remove conflict between the trek netters and beach users
• ensure safety of the public during a trek
• optimise the success and efficacy of the trek.
The following protocols have been identified (more detail provided in Chapter 19 of the full
CMP):
Use of Vehicles in the Coastal Environment
Use of vehicles on the beach is controlled under the Off-Road Vehicle Regulations.
All
vehicles associated with trek netting need to display their trek netting registration and
may not travel on a City beach at speeds greater that 15 km/h.
A maximum of two
vehicles per permit holder is allowed on the beach.
Area of Jurisdiction
This protocol applies to high-intensity recreation nodes at Muizenberg Corner, Big Bay
Beach and Fish Hoek Beach.
The protocol does not apply to trekking along the
Strandfontein coastline, at Macassar Beach or at Mackerel Beach as these areas are not
considered high-intensity recreation nodes.
Method of Deployment
Prior to deployment, operators need to notify the relevant parties and deployment of
nets may only occur once the beach has been closed.
At no point may trek netters
deploy their net in such a way that it encircles any water users.
Trek net rights-holders
need to inform the relevant officials before launching their vessels and nets according to
their permit and this protocol.
Public Engagement
At no time may trek netters provide (sell, barter or donate) any fish caught during the trek
to any City officials.
No member of the public may approach or interfere with permitted
trek netters, their equipment, net or targeted school of fish.
CHAPTER 20: DUNE MANAGEMENT
Cape Town’s coastal dune systems are being compromised and transformed due to expanding
urban development, which means that fewer dune systems in the City remain functional. The
restriction of these dune systems to narrow belts through encroachment requires such systems to
be actively managed.
These sand dunes are of critical importance because they act as a buffer
against storm surge events and trap wind-blown sand thereby reducing quantities of sand
smothering coastal infrastructure.
They also serve as an important habitat for biodiversity.
Dune
management in the City must therefore become a priority activity that is well resourced and is
an ongoing management requirement.
Current dune management within the City is informed by several guiding principles:
• Regulate and avoid human interference in areas where dune systems remain functional.
•
Implement management interventions at sites where dune systems have been seriously
altered.
• Use exotic plant species and mechanical shaping to manage dunes in an already •
altered system.
Implement a slow but managed replacement of alien plant species with indigenous
plants in dune systems that are currently stabilised.
• Mechanically remove excess sand build-up when necessary.
Dune management plans will be developed by the Environmental Resource Management
Department and will be used to guide the management of dune systems along the City’s
coastline.
The responsibility of implementing these plans and ongoing dune management
resides with different authorities depending on the location of the dune system:
The Sport, Recreation and Amenities Department will be responsible for dune systems
located at beach recreational nodal points.
These defined areas are listed in Section 6 of
Chapter 20 of the full CMP.
The Environmental Resource Management Department will be responsible for dune
systems located in those areas defined as natural coastal areas.
These defined areas are
listed in Section 7 of Chapter 20 of the full CMP.
CHAPTER 21: HELDERBERG MARINE PROTECTED AREA MANAGEMENT PLAN
The Helderberg Marine Protected Area (MPA) is situated on the north-eastern side of False
Bay and falls within the jurisdiction of the City of Cape Town.
It was proclaimed under the
Marine Living Resources Act in 2000 as a no-take MPA and is managed in terms of the
National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act.
The Helderberg MPA is
approximately 4 km long and consists of a sandy shoreline between the Eerste River mouth in
the east and the Lourens River mouth in the west.
The MPA extends 500 m offshore from the
high-water mark.
The purpose of the management plan is to describe the Helderberg MPA, its management
objectives, the methods by which these objectives will be achieved and the methods for
measuring the success of the MPA.
The management plan has been compiled by the City of
Cape Town and draws on international guidelines of MPA management as well as national
requirements.
Chapter 21 of the full CMP is structured according to the following sections:
Section A: Background information
Section A discusses the goals and objectives of the MPA and provides an overview of
the site location and habitat.
Section B: Management of the MPA, its user groups and key species found therein
Section B discusses the conservation action for key species in the protected area and
lists the management objectives for various activities within the MPA.
Section C: Management of infrastructure and equipment
Section C lists the equipment and capacity requirements for the management of the
MPA.
Section D: Compliance
Section D lists the compliance objectives and enforcement operations for the MPA.
Section E: Capacity
Section E discusses the skill requirements for the MPA Manager and any relevant staff.
Section F: Awareness
Section F describes how awareness regarding the MPA will be promoted, through
engagement with various user groups.
Section G: Scientific research and monitoring
Section G describes how various indicators of the physical and biophysical
environment will be monitored.
Section H: Funding, responsibilities, auditing and conclusion
Section H discusses how auditing of the management activities will be conducted
and the effectiveness of the MPA will be ensured.
CHAPTER 22: COASTAL CONSERVANCIES
The City has defined and identified various sites along the coastline as Coastal
Conservancies.
These sites reflect Cape Town’s diverse coastal environment, and serve to
protect these unique spaces from unconsidered urban development.
Coastal Conservancies
differ from nature reserves in that they aim to be well integrated within the urban
environment, they are accessible to a wide range of users and activities, and they require
minimal regulation.
A Coastal Conservancy will be a formal category of land protected by
regulations in the Coastal Overlay Zone, as part of the City’s Zoning Scheme.
The City of
Cape Town defines a Coastal Conservancy as:
‘A coastal space, under the administration of the City, that is characteristically unique,
representative of the diversity of the City’s coastline, represents unique coastal habitat,
dynamics and processes, and or heritage and social value that is irreplaceable and of long-
term value to society as a whole and for future generations.’
The areas in Cape Town that have been identified as Coastal Conservancies include:
• Witsands-Soetwater Coastal Conservancy
• Burgher’s Walk-Miller’s Point Coastal Conservancy
• Macassar Dunes Coastal Conservancy
• Gordon’s Bay Coastal Conservancy
• Kogel Bay Coastal Conservancy
The following principles will be applicable to all areas defined as a Coastal Conservancy:
The areas are retained as natural coastal space, while encouraging public access
through appropriate activities and amenities.
• Access will be unfenced and unrestricted, unless a formal coastal resort falls within
the conservancy.
There will be minimal intervention of natural system processes.
•
• Archaeological and heritage sites will be mapped, protected and managed
accordingly.
Social heritage will be documented and reflected within the conservancy.
Landscapes and vistas will be protected as a core asset of the conservancy. •
• Development of amenities and resorts will respect the natural coastline and be
limited to spaces that are already disturbed within the conservancy.
• Appropriate infrastructure will be developed to support and facilitate both core
Chapter 22 of the full CMP further identifies and maps coastal land parcels that will
be formalised as Coastal Conservancies and provides a broad overview for each in
The Coastal Overlay Zone is further described in Chapter 6: City of Cape Town Zoning Scheme: General Overlay Zone.
CHAPTER 23: ESTUARY MANAGEMENT PLANS
The National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act, (Act 24 of
2008) (ICM Act) stipulates that all estuaries in South Africa must be managed in a
coordinated and efficient manner, in accordance with a National Estuarine Management
Protocol.
This protocol provides guidance for the management of estuaries through the
development and implementation of individual Estuarine Management Plans (EMPs).
These
EMPs aim to achieve a greater degree of coordination between ecological processes and
human activities, while accommodating sustainable estuarine resource utilisation.
The National Estuarine Management Protocol requires all EMPs to contain the following
information:
• An executive summary that highlights the key information that will influence
management decisions within the estuary.
• A geographical description and map of the estuary, clearly identifying the
boundaries of the system.
The local vision and objectives of the estuary.
• A list of management objectives for a variety of stipulated activities.
that may or may not take place in certain sections of the estuary.
• A detailed and integrated monitoring plan with a list of performance indicators.
• Details of the institutional capacity and arrangements required for managing
different elements of the EMP.
Chapter 23 of the full CMP contains the following EMPs in accordance with the requirements
of the National Environmental Management: ICM Act and the National Estuarine
Management Protocol: Zandvlei Estuary Management Plan
• Diep River Estuary Management Plan
• Eerste River Estuary Management Plan
• Hout Bay Estuary Management Plan
Lourens River Estuary Management Plan
Silvermine River Estuary Management Plan
Sir Lowry’s Pass River Estuary Management Plan
Zeekoevlei Estuary Management Plan
EMPs have not been developed by the City for those estuaries that fall within the boundaries
of Table Mountain National Park.
These estuaries are managed by Table Mountain National Park in accordance with park management plans.
CHAPTER 24: WATER QUALITY MONITORING AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROTOCOL
The City of Cape Town conducts regular water quality tests at specific beaches and tidal
pools along its coastline.
This testing is necessary to ensure that users of the City’s beaches
are not exposed to any health risks associated with polluted water and to make the
necessary management interventions in case of poor water quality.
A number of different
line departments are involved in water quality testing, which is conducted according to the
interim guidelines of the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA).
The City will disseminate
these water quality statistics for public information as part of the biennial State of the
Environment Report.
Monitoring procedure
Samples will be collected at specific beaches and tidal pools twice a month, throughout the year.
A list of these sample sites is available as Annexure A in Chapter 24 of the full
CMP. The water samples will be tested by the City of Cape Town’s Scientific Services
department for the indicator organisms of Escherichia coli and Enterococci.
Results from these tests will be used to inform any appropriate action that needs to be taken by the
relevant line departments.
Recreational water quality guidelines
The City’s water quality guidelines will be informed by the national guidelines as set by
the DEA.
These guidelines are applicable to the recreational waters of South Africa’s
marine environment, and replace the previous guidelines of the Department of Water
Affairs and Forestry (DWAF).
In terms of the new DEA guidelines, the ’sufficient/fair’ grade will be applied as the
minimum requirement for determining acceptable water quality over the long term. A
table of these water quality standards is available in Chapter 24 of the full CMP
Programme.
The following line departments are involved in water quality testing in the City:
• Environmental Health: Monitors the quality of water and places health warning signs
at closed beaches.
Stormwater and Sustainability: Coordinates and funds the coastal water quality
monitoring programme.
Any investigations of pollution issues will be carried out by this
department.
• Environmental Resource Management: Assists with coastal management advice and
is responsible for the implementation of coastal management plans as required by
the National Environmental Management: ICM Act (Act 24 of 2008).
• Water and Sanitation: Scientific Services are responsible for collecting and analysing
water quality samples.
This is done in accordance with a service level agreement
between Scientific Services and the Environmental Health Department.
Sport, Recreation and Amenities: Manages the City’s beaches and places health
warning signs at closed beaches. •
CHAPTER 25: COASTAL SIGNAGE PROTOCOL
Signage and information plays a key role in the coastal environment, where it is used to
provide both general information to beach users as well as information about rules and
regulations.
The City of Cape Town has developed a Coastal Signage Protocol in order to
ensure consistency, transparency and effective communication of information within the
coastal environment.
The protocol defines coastal signage as any object, product, replica,
advertising structure, mural, device, board, poster or billboard which serves to publicly
display information in the coastal zone, on beaches, the seashore and in the ocean.
The intention of the Coastal Signage Protocol is to:
• Provide the City of Cape Town’s beach users with visible, informative, consistent and
well maintained coastal signage, which will enable users to make informed decisions
regarding beach safety and behaviour.
• Manage coastal signage in a manner that respects the integrity and aesthetics of the
surrounding environment.
• Be aligned to the City’s brand guidelines.
The Coastal Signage Protocol is guided by several principles which are further described in
Section 3, Chapter 25 of the full CMP, namely:
• Recognition of the value of the coastline and a commitment to maintain this to the
highest standards.
• A responsibility to provide beach users with relevant information about risk and
regulations; subsequent actions are the responsibility of the beach user.
• A responsibility to signpost entry points to coastal access land, in line with the ICM Act
(Act 24 of 2008).
• Recognition that damaged signage can detract from the integrity and aesthetics of •
a location.
The frequency of signage must be aligned to the density of beach users along the
coastline.
• Recognition of the need for consistency and standards in coastal signage.
• Alignment between the protocol and the City’s Outdoor Signage and Advertising By-
law.
• Alignment between the protocol and the City’s brand guidelines.
Chapter 25 of the full CMP elaborates on the following topics:
Section 4:
Section 5:
Section 6:
Section 7:
Administrative processes
Coastal signage protocols for primary and secondary signage
Commercially sponsored and non-profit coastal signage
This protocol will be applicable to both internal City line departments as well as external
organisations displaying coastal signage within the jurisdiction of the City of Cape Town.
CHAPTER 26: COASTAL CLEANING PROTOCOL
The City has developed a Coastal Cleaning Protocol which specifies the principles,
responsibilities and procedures for beach cleaning along the coastline.
Beach cleaning is
defined as a service activity provided by the City of Cape Town that removes waste material
from City beaches and rocky shores between the low water mark and the first fixed
infrastructure on City-owned boundaries.
Beach cleaning is important for maintaining a high standard of coastal space that can be
enjoyed by various types of recreational beach users.
Yet the City also recognises the
ecological importance of not removing certain natural debris – such as kelp wrack, red bait
and shells – which play a significant role in moderating coastal processes.
As such, the
Coastal Cleaning Protocol is informed by the following guiding principles:
• All beaches and rocky shores will primarily be managed as ecological systems.
The City’s coastline is a valuable asset and will – to the best of the City’s abilities – be
kept free of waste material.
The coastline experiences varying degrees of user intensity, and will be managed
accordingly. •
• Maintaining a clean coastal environment is a shared responsibility between City’s line
departments, external organisations and individual beach users.
Central to the Coastal Cleaning Policy is the City’s definition of waste.
The City considers
both human-made products and domestic animal excrement to be waste, yet natural debris
such as kelp wrack, red bait or shells is not considered to be waste.
The Coastal Cleaning
Protocol addresses the management and removal of waste and natural debris in the
following sections of Chapter 26 in the full CMP:
Section 7.1: General beach cleaning protocols
Section 7.2: Kelp wrack and red bait removal
Section 7.3: Deep sand cleaning
Section 7.4:
Section 7.5: Litter picking and waste removal
Shells and shell fragment removal
The intention of the Coastal Cleaning Protocol is to provide the City of Cape Town and its
communities with a clean beach and coastal environment to the highest standards and free
of waste material, while protecting the natural processes and dynamics.
The removal of oil, toxic and hazardous waste is addressed in Chapter 12: Coastal
Emergency Plans.
Coastal waste removal of marine animal carcasses is addressed in Chapter 13: Large
Marine Animal Stranding Policy.
CHAPTER 27: COASTAL MONITORING PROGRAMME
The City of Cape Town’s coastline is a harsh and dynamic environment, which is constantly
undergoing change.
This change can be either predictable or unpredictable, and similarly it
can occur over both a short (seasonal) time scale or over longer and less defined periods of
time.
Examples of predictable coastal change include the accretion of beaches in False Bay
during the winter and their erosion during the summer months, while the opposite trend is
seen to occur on the West Coast.
Examples of unpredictable coastal change include the
migration of estuary mouths, storm surge induced coastal erosion and localised beach
regression and accretion events.
This dynamic nature of the coastline is a source of risk to the
City, as both abrupt and deliberate change will impact on coastal infrastructure and
ultimately on the City’s ability to maintain effective service delivery.
The Coastal Monitoring Programme is a GIS-based programme that aims to record and
collate these biophysical changes along the City’s coastline.
This information will be used to both:
inform and guide the daily operations and decision-making within the City
inform higher-level strategic policy intents on how the City needs to respond and
manage the coast, through the identification of risk.
The City’s Coastal Monitoring Programme will provide a more holistic understanding of
coastal processes through the use of the following:
Aerial imagery
The use of aerial imagery in time series provides a powerful tool to determine both trends
on coastal processes and the impact of decision-making on coastal processes. The City
takes aerial imagery for the entire metropolitan area every year.
Fixed-point photography
Fixed-point photography is conducted at specific locations along the City’s coastline.
Images with the same bearing, perspective and photographic settings are taken during
low tide once a year and used as a time series to reflect change along the coastline.
Coastal profile ponitoring
Coastal profile monitoring tracks the change in the profile of the coastal littoral active zone.
The analysis of the change in beach profiles enables the City to better understand
rates of erosion and accretion along the coast both in terms of natural variation and in
response to human interventions.
Storm surge run-up monitoring
Spatial data from actual storm surge events is captured and recorded within the Coastal
Monitoring Programme.
This enables the City to better compare modelled storm surge predictions with those of real events.
This will allow the City to disaggregate risk per
location and to predict those locations that will be at higher risk of storm damage.
CHAPTER 28: EDUCATION, AWARENESS AND TRAINING STRATEGY
The Environmental Resource Management Department is responsible for the organisation
and co-ordination of the City’s coastal education and awareness programmes. These
programmes are designed to equip the public, staff and councillors with specific coastal
information and skills.
They are informed by the City’s Environmental Awareness, Education
and Training Strategy, which provides a framework for the planning and implementation of
these educational programmes.
A number of both external partners and internal line departments contribute to the City’s
education and training programme, including:
External partners: The Two Oceans Aquarium, Shark Spotters, Wildlife and Environment
Society of South Africa (WESSA), Save Our Seas
Internal line departments: Sport, Recreation and Amenities, Solid Waste, Water and
Sanitation, Tourism.
The City has designed three different programmes as part of its Environmental, Education
and Training strategy: •
Learner education programme
This programme forms part of the City’s Youth Environmental Schools (YES) initiative
and is particularly focused on learners from vulnerable communities who live near to
the coastline.
The Blue Flag Environmental Education programme, Marine Week, and
site visits to the City’s coastal nature reserves form an important component of the
learner education programme.
Chapter 28 of the full CMP elaborates further on the
specific focus areas of the learner education programme.
Educator training programme
The educator training programme takes place on an annual basis and is aimed at
enabling local educators to conduct their own environmental education and
awareness programmes.
An emphasis is placed on coastal management and the
use of Blue Flag beaches as outdoor classrooms.
Chapter 28 in the full CMP
elaborates further on the specific focus areas of the educator training programme.
Staff education and training
This component places a focus on developing practical skills, while recognising and
enhancing trainees’ existing skills.
Training courses are offered to better equip staff for
their different roles and functions.
The City of Cape Town’s Environmental Awareness, Education and Training Strategy
can be accessed on the City’s Environmental Resource Management website, under
‘Publications’ and ‘Policies and Strategies’.
www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement
CHAPTER 29: EVENTS POLICY
Cape Town has a strong track record as an events destination and has hosted major global
events such as the 1995 Rugby World Cup, 2003 Cricket World Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup.
The City has therefore developed a strong global brand and wishes to use this strength to
develop as an events destination of choice.
The City would like to exploit the occurrence of
events in the City to achieve strategic objectives such as economic growth, job creation,
social inclusivity, and environmental and event greening goals. The Events Policy therefore
provides the necessary management framework to improve the hosting of events within the
City of Cape Town.
The desired outcomes of this Events Policy are to:
• Create mutually beneficial outcomes for Cape Town residents, businesses and visitors
by using events as a platform to contribute to the City’s economy and growth.
• Create an enabling mechanism for new approaches to event initiatives.
• Create stability in the City’s events calendar and clearly define processes and
systems that support events.
• Encourage innovation and new initiatives through the hosting of events.
Chapter 29 of the full CMP further outlines the following sections: Section 2:

CHAPTER 30: COASTAL COMMITTEES
The Integrated Coastal Management Act (Act 24 of 2008) makes provision in section 42 for
the option of establishing a Municipal Coastal Committee.
As a result of Cape Town’s
variable and extensive coastline, however, the City has opted not to form such a Municipal
Coastal Committee.
The City will instead make use of existing functional structures to ensure
public and stakeholder engagement with regard to the management of our coastline.
The City recognises the importance and value of public engagement and consultation, due
to the diverse nature of interest groups, commercial activities, economic growth
opportunities and employment creation potential along our coastline. As such,
management of Cape Town’s coastline will be facilitated by engaging with the public and
relevant stakeholders regarding:
• proposed coastal policies and by-laws
• the City’s CMP
• any significant review or amendment of individual chapters of the City’s CMP after its
adoption (See Chapter 31)
• any land use activity that requires an Environmental Impact Assessment, as required
by the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA).
Direct engagement on all coastal matters will be referred through the existing structures of
ward councillors, ward forums and subcouncils.
CHAPTER 31: MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING
According to section 49(d) of the Integrated Coastal Management Act (Act 24 of 2008), the
Municipal Coastal Management Programme must include:
‘(d) performance indicators to measure progress with the achievement of those objectives’
Chapter 31 of the full CMP outlines the method for monitoring and evaluating this plan by
the City of Cape Town.
This will be conducted according to the following guidelines:
• • Every five years
The CMP will undergo a formal review every five years as prescribed by the
Integrated Coastal Management Act (Act 24 of 2008).
Every two years
A City Coastal Report will be prepared on a biannual basis.
This will present
information relating to the State of the Coast, the most current Coastal Risk Register,
prosecutions, records of non-compliance and coastal emergencies.
• Constant revision
Individual chapters will be reviewed and amended as the need arises.
This will be
conducted in accordance with Council processes and public consultation.
TOP WAYS TO SAVE
WATER INDOORS
Cape Town has water restrictions in place.
Keep saving by taking these key indoor actions.
1 5 5
Only flush when necessary.
Don’t use it as a dustbin.
‘If it’s yellow let it mellow.
If it’s brown, flush it down.’
Take a short 2-minute shower.
A standard (non–water-saving)
showerhead can use as much
as 16 litres per minute.
Collect your shower, bath and
basin water and re-use it to
flush your toilet, and for the
garden and car cleaning. *
Wait for a full load before running
washing machines and dishwashers.
The rinse water from some
washing machines can be
re-used for the next wash cycle.
Use a cup instead of running
taps in the bathroom or
kitchen for brushing teeth,
shaving, drinking etc.
Defrost foods in the fridge or
naturally rather than placing it
under running water.
Switch to an efficient showerhead
which uses no more than
10 litres per minute, as
per the City’s By-law.
Upgrade to a multi-flush toilet
and/or put a water displacement
item in the cistern which can halve
your water use per flush.
Fit taps with aerators or
restrictors to reduce flow to no
more than 6 litres per minute,
as per the City’s By-law.
Report pipe bursts by SMS 31373 (max 160 characters) and water wastage to: water@capetown.gov.za

*Only 1 x 1,3 ton load per person per day accepted for garage waste and clean builder’s rubble.
**Only 3 x 1,3 ton loads per person per day accepted for clean garden waste.
A new tariff of R57 (VAT incl) was introduced for a load of builder’s rubble in excess of 1,3 tons.
Loads of less than 1,3 tons remain free.
Note: Garage waste is defined as any household waste other than residential waste, clean builder’s rubble or clean garden refuse generated at residential properties. • Clean garden waste is
defined as superfluous vegetation generated by gardening activities on properties zoned and used for residential or domestic purposes in the City of Cape Town’s municipal jurisdiction. • Clean
builder’s rubble is defined as waste consisting of broken bricks, sand stone, cement, plaster and similar inert materials, but excluding paper, plastic, wood, glass, metal and hazardous waste. Clean
builder’s rubble is utilised for the construction of temporary roads on disposal sites and should therefore not damage vehicle tyres.

Water and SanitationEverything you need to know ... but were afraid to ask!BLOCKAGES
• Do not drain rainwater from the roof and paving into the sewer.• Ensure that all manhole covers and access covers on rodding eyes and external pipework are in place.
This prevents odours and cockroaches from exiting the system and sand, stone, sticks, toys, etc from entering the system.• Do not try to unblock your private drain.
Call a plumber to assist you.Stormwater drainsStormwater drains are often mistakenly used as a wastewater disposal system.
It should be noted that stormwater drains are provided by the municipality solely to drain excess rainwater away so that ﬂooding is minimised.
When these drains are used as a disposal point for oil, fat, builders rubble, etc, blockages occur in the system and the risk of ﬂooding is heightened when the rains come down.
What causes blockages?
The sort of things that cause blockages are fats, rags, tampons, hair, roots, sand, newspaper, disposable nappies, building materials, oil, stones, plastics, sharp objects, cutlery and even the bodies of fetuses.• Fat is a major problem because it builds up inside certain types of pipes.
It acts like glue attracting rags, hair, paper, plastics and in no time, a blockage is caused.• Oil, parafﬁn, paint etc, contaminate thousands of litres of sewage and cause serious problems at the treatment works.• Discharging stormwater (rainwater) into the sewer can overload the sewer and ﬁll it completely which could result in the discharge of sewerage out of the manholes into the street.
Preventative measuresThe following preventative measures may be taken to ensure that the sewerage system does not block:• Allow fat (from fatty food when cooking) to cool and congeal or solidify.
Once this is solid, wrap it in newspaper or put it in a bag before placingin the refuse bin which is collected weekly.• Rags, paper, tampons and disposable nappies should be disposed of in the normal household bin or sanitary bins provided by businesses. • Sand often enters the sewer system due to illegal connections from stormwater drains.
Building inspectors should ensure a full inspection of all buildings before signing off the inspection sheet.
On your own premises, sweep sand away from the drains and dispose of it in small amounts in the normal household bin, or at your local drop-off site. • Roots growing through the sewer system are very common.
The Environment is very conducive to the development of root growth and there is not really a solution except if you fell the tree. • Most building materials enter the sewer system when contractors/ builders dump these materials into the sewer through the manholes.
This causes unnecessary stress on the system. • Most illegal dumping of oil occurs in the industrial areas as well as garages.
The only way to prevent this is to have inspections on a regular basis. • Sometimes even the bodies of fetuses are found in the sewer system.Do not try to unblock your private drain.

FIND AND FIX LEAKS
Leaks can waste a lot of water, especially if they are undetected or underground and left for a long time.
Leaks on your
property are your responsibility.
So here’s a guide to finding and fixing them quickly, to save water and save you money.
HOW TO CHECK FOR LEAKS
ON YOUR PROPERTY
3 SIMPLE TESTS FOR A
TOILET LEAK
1
STOP
2
53210423
3
4
5
Close all taps on the property and
don’t flush toilets.
CHECK AND RECORD YOUR METER READING.
WAIT 15 MINUTES AND TAKE ANOTHER READING.
Make sure that nobody has opened
a tap or flushed since you first
noted the meter reading.
IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE,
YOU HAVE A LEAK TO FIX.
If the number on the meter has
increased, it means you have a leak
and you need to take action as per
the City’s By-law.
CALL A PLUMBER TO HELP
FIX THE LEAK.
Unless its a simple DIY job.
One leaking toilet wastes between about 2 600 and
13 000 litres per month, depending on the flow rate
of the leak. A leaking tap wastes between about
400 and 2 600 litres per month.
Listen for water
trickling into the toilet bowl.
Press a piece of toilet paper against the
inside back surface
of the bowl. If it gets
wet, you probably
have a leak.
Put 15 drops of food
colouring into the
toilet cistern.
If after
15 minutes the water
in the toilet bowl has
changed colour, there is a leak.
If you can’t afford to call a plumber to fix a serious
toilet problem, use the little stopcock/‘angle valve’

SUMMARY: CITY OF CAPE TOWN 2017- 2022
COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED
TRANSPORT PLAN
The City is intent on building a more inclusive, integrated and vibrant city that addresses the
legacies of apartheid, rectiﬁes existing imbalances in the distribution of different types of
residential development, and avoids the creation of new structural imbalances in the delivery of
services.
It regards transport as a key driver for addressing Cape Town’s spatial reality and is
aiming to achieve a spatial transformation through transit-oriented development (TOD) and
associated densiﬁcation.
The Draft Comprehensive Integrated Transport Plan, 2017 to 2022 (CITP), is a new ﬁve year statutory plan prepared in
terms of Section 36 (1) National Land Transport Act, No. 5 of 2009.
The plan aligns with the new term of Ofﬁce IDP
2017 – 2022, and integrates with the review of the Municipal Spatial Development Framework.
The content and structure of the CITP is guided by the Government Gazette, No. 40174 of 29 July 2016 which
stipulates the “Minimum Requirements for the Preparation of Integrated Transport Plans”.
The CITP gives the City of Cape Town (and so its Transport Authority, Transport and Urban Development Authority for
Cape Town (TDA)), its mandate for the transport network and everything that moves on it and sets out what TDA is
committed to and is accountable for.
In this new CITP, the City of Cape Town sets out how it will build on the progress it has made in delivering integrated,
intermodal and interoperable transport in Cape Town.
Taking each component in turn: • •
• Integrated: the City's delivery of integrated transport is based on its Integrated Public Transport Network Plan
2032.
"Integrated", however, should not just be conﬁned to transport but should also mean the integration of
transport with land use.
For the City, this means the use of transit-oriented development (TOD) to bring about the
spatial transformation of Cape Town itself as well as the building of sustainable communities.
Intermodal: intermodal transport cannot be delivered in Cape Town unless all functions and modes are under the
jurisdiction of a single authority.
To this end, the City is continuing to pursue the assignments of the Contracting
Authority and the Municipal Regulatory Entity (MRE) functions respectively.
The City also acknowledges that
although rail is considered to be the “backbone” of its transport system, it is currently in crisis.
The City is therefore
considering how to deal with this crisis in Cape Town.
Interoperable: in order to achieve an interoperable transport system (the ability of a transport system to work with
another without special effort on the part of the commuter), the City will be undertaking further work on the
delivery of integrated ticketing and timetables.
The City's approach to integrated transport is to adopt multi-modalism.
The key modes are passenger rail, bus rapid
transit (BRT), quality bus services (being conventional bus services enhanced by modernising features and integration
with the wider network and which operate mainly in mixed trafﬁc) and minibus-taxis. These modes will together form
part of an integrated transport solution which will be complemented by improved provision for NMT and new
e-hailing and related technologies in the coming decades and will result in a "new generation" of service offerings.
The City's approach to Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)
Integrated transport also needs to be viewed through the much broader perspective of how the City intends to use
transport to change the spatial form of Cape Town itself as well as to build sustainable communities.
This means that
the City does not see integrated transport as its only goal.
Instead, it regards transport as the key driver for addressing
Cape Town’s spatial reality, with all its urban inefﬁciencies and social inequality.
The City recognised that TOD could
be applied in Cape Town not just as other cities had used it for economic and transport efﬁciency purposes but also to
bring about spatial transformation and build sustainable communities.
In this way, a step change will be achieved by
prioritising the right development in the right locations, along major road and rail corridors in Cape Town.
This
approach, coupled with a focus on public transport (PT) and non-motorised transport (NMT), will reduce travel times
and costs, as well as deliver important environmental beneﬁts.
This CITP therefore sets out the City's ambitious but
deliverable plans for transport within the wider context of its drive to create an equal society based on integrated
communities, economic inclusion and access to opportunities in Cape Town.
In order to give effect to this scale of TOD in Cape Town, the City needed it to be driven at both an institutional and
governance level.
As a result, it extended the functions of its then Transport Authority, Transport for Cape Town (TCT),
to include all of urban development (urban planning, human settlements and urban sustainability) alongside
integrated transport.
The City's approach to rail
The transport system in Cape Town is highly dependent on rail as its backbone but the serious decline in service has
forced many passengers onto the road network, leading to gridlock during the peak periods.
The City is currently
considering various strategies necessary to address the situation.
The City cannot deliver integrated, intermodal and interoperable transport in Cape Town without an effective rail
component.
Furthermore, rail is not just the backbone of the transport system but also of Cape Town's spatial form as
well.
As such, the intensiﬁcation and densiﬁcation of land use along rail corridors is also a key part of the City's TOD
strategy. In response, the City is developing a methodology to explore what needs to be done to solve the issues in
rail. The transport trends in Cape Town
This CITP has been prepared at a time when the City faces many challenges both in terms of transport and the City's
spatial form.
It takes forward the progress made by TCT through adapting its transport mission, vision and long-term
strategies to use this CITP as a driver of change to address these challenges head on.
The CITP recognises key
transport trends in Cape Town that need to be addressed if these opportunities are to be realised: •
• •
the deterioration of the rail service in Cape Town, with its resultant steep decrease in usage and increase in
road usage the increasingly unsustainable cost of transport for low income households, as revealed by the City's Transport
Development Index the growing disjuncture between transport and land use in Cape Town
TDA’s proposed interventions
This CITP presents TDA’s proposals to address these trends and opportunities through interventions that are required
to achieve TDA’s Integrated Transport Vision and the proposed implementation of TOD via policies and programs
pertaining to public transport, rollout program of public transport, infrastructure, travel demand management,
non-motorised transport, freight, and other transport related interventions.
A summarised, ﬁnancially viable and
costed set of proposals and programs is also presented in this document.
Executive summary
The mid-1960s marked the start of a major increase in private motor vehicle ownership in South
Africa and in Cape Town.
In response, the transport strategy for Cape Town, at the time, centred on
the expansion of the road network with the aim of accommodating the mobility desires of private
vehicle users amid increasing suburbanisation.
This resulted in the severing of communities and in
many areas, eliminating the option of cycling as a viable and safe means of transport.
As a result, the
modal share of cycling in Cape Town (cycling’s share of all daily trips made compared to the use of
other transport modes) has decreased since the 1980s, while there has also been a steady decline in
learners cycling to school.
Worldwide, the renaissance and growth of commuter cycling is increasingly recognised as a vital
contributor to cities striving to be liveable and sustainable.
Realising that cycling is an increasingly
important part of a transport solution for Cape Town, the City embarked on the development of a
cycling strategy.
This was done with the input from a broad range of cycling stakeholders to
encourage and grow utility cycling (cycling other than for recreation or sports purposes) across the
city and establish a vision for cycling, identify desired outcomes and determine five key focus areas.
The proposed vision for cycling for Cape Town is as follows:
To make Cape Town the premier cycling city in South Africa, where cycling is an accepted, accessible
and popular mode of transport for all – residents and visitors alike.
During the past 10 years, recreational and sports cycling (road cycling and mountain biking) has
grown tremendously, evident from the high numbers of recreational and sports cyclists observed on
the roads and participating in events.
In sharp contrast to the high level of recreational cycling, the
level of utility cycling is generally very low.
One of the challenges in Cape Town is how to increase
utility cycling and accordingly the mode share.
Since 2008, the City of Cape Town has initiated infrastructure programmes aimed at the provision of a
cycling, pedestrian and universal access network and facilities.
The infrastructure-focused approach
has unfortunately not been enough to effectively increase the mode share and make cycling an
accepted utility mode of transport.
Reviews of successful cycling cities confirm that in order to effectively encourage and grow cycling, a
comprehensive cycling programme must be undertaken.
The key focus areas prioritised during the
development of this cycling strategy for the promotion and growth of utility cycling reflect this broader
approach and include the following: improved access to bicycles, improved safety and security,
provision and maintenance of cycling infrastructure, regular monitoring and evaluation to determine
behavioural change, and stakeholder consultation.
The desired outcome of the cycling strategy is to
increase cycling’s mode share from the current 1% to 8% by 2030, which will contribute to a reduction
in congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.
Cape Town has real potential for the growth of utility cycling for local commuter trips of between
10 km and 15 km and for road and rail public transport feeder trips across income groups in the short
to medium term.
In achieving the vision for cycling and its desired outcomes, the cycling strategy for Cape Town will
guide policies, programmes and projects to address the current and emerging needs of cyclists and
support the continued growth of cycling into a major form of personal transport.
The cycling strategy must be reviewed and updated at least once every five years to be in line with
the City’s Comprehensive Integrated Transport Plan (CITP) and to stay abreast of changes in the
planning environment and the needs of its users.
Executive Summary
The Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) for the 1st quarter of 2017 reflects an official
unemployment rate of 27,7% for South Africa and an unemployment rate of 22,7% for Cape
Town. Unemployment in Cape Town is concentrated among the youth and in certain areas
within the city.
In response to this challenge, the City of Cape Town (CCT) has prioritised the creation of
sustainable and decent work opportunities, while recognising that only business can create
the sustainable jobs that this city and our country need.
Furthermore, the CCT aims to create
an enabling environment to attract investment that generates economic growth and job
creation.
The Investment Incentives Policy focuses on the use of incentives to increase private sector
job-creating investment, particularly in areas of high unemployment, and within key sectors.
Furthermore, it sets out a package of incentives that relates specifically to the CCT’s
mandate, and complements the range of incentives offered by the provincial and national
spheres of government.
The following principles have been applied to the development of the incentive package:
1 Subject to further discussion with Finance
Transparency and uniformity Sectoral, spatial and employment impact targeted
Simplicity
Legality
• Affordability
•
•
• •
• Complementarity and alignment
• Continuous review
The policy presents a package of incentives including the following:
Financial1
• Rebates on property tax
• Reduction in service charges
• Discounted development charges for new development and expansions
• Reduced building plan application costs
• Reduced land use management application costs
• Broadband line rental waiver
Non-financial Support services from the Atlantis Investment Facilitation Office
Investor support from an investment facilitation unit for the rest of the City
Fast-tracking of development applications
• • •
• Regularly updated quarterly economic information
What is the Investment Incentives Policy?
The Investment Incentives Policy is the document that outlines the approach that the CCT will
take in providing incentives for investment in the city.
What does it aim to achieve?
The CCT recognises the nature and extent of the unemployment challenge facing the city.
Within its mandate of the “creation of an enabling environment” for economic activity, the
Investment Incentives Policy provides the CCT the with a number of levers that will
encourage investment in the city.
Who will it apply to?
The Investment Incentives Policy will apply to investors who want to invest in new business
activity or the expansion of existing activities within specific priority sectors and declining
industrial and commercial nodes within the city.
Most importantly, the policy will apply to
new investment that will create direct employment.
BRIEF SUMMARY ON THE MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT PLAN (MMP)
Background and intent of the project:
The City of Cape Town has a dynamic coastline subject to various coastal processes
including, inter alia, erosion, accretion and wind-blown sand.
Due to the nature of
Cape Town’s coastline, public infrastructure such as roads and walkways in close
proximity to the coastline are frequently either smothered with wind-blown sand or
undercut by erosion.
Given the dynamic nature of the City’s coastline and the need to maintain
infrastructure and provide access to the beachfront for members of the public at all
times, a Maintenance Management Plan (MMP) has been prepared.
This MMP will
enable the immediate and ongoing management of beaches and dune systems in
compliance with the requirements of the National Environmental Management Act
(NEMA) No. 107 of 1998 and the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulations
(2014).
