the province has continued to achieve more than
97% on Municipal infrastructure Grant expenditure.
The Back to Basics programme was utilised as a vehicle to provide differentiated
levels of support to municipalities.
The Department supported municipalities with targeted and integrated capacity-
building initiatives.
This includes shared services, mentoring and coaching as well
as good governance projects.
Eighteen (18) municipalities were supported with the development of a standardised
ICT website.
An audit on the functionality of the Bulk-SMS System across municipalities was
conducted.
The Department supported some municipalities with the development
and upgrade of the system to ensure efficient implementation.
strengthening joint co-ordination, planning
and community involvement
The IDP is the most important vehicle for development in communities, as it is the
foundation for aligning budgets of municipalities with the needs of the communities
they serve.
Department has therefore supported a range of projects concerning IDP
in communities:
The Department co-ordinated the IDP Indaba Working Group, as well as the Joint
Planning Initiative (JPI) process.
These were rolled out to all districts.
The Department continues to encourage and sustain the dialogue between all
spheres of government through platforms such as the MinMaytec, MinMay as
well as the PCF meetings.
During these engagements, municipal managers, the
Premier, and senior managers from the Western Cape Government engaged on
issues affecting local government.
The Department supported Community Based Planning (CBP) as it serves as one
of the forerunners to the IDP process that creates an environment for meaningful
participation in municipal IDP processes and enhances community ownership over
development.
CBP Train-the-Trainer course was rolled out to eighteen (18) officials from eight
municipalities.

The Thusong programmes, along with the Community Development Worker Programme,
continue to play a critical role in ensuring that information and government services are
accessed by all citizens.
At the end of the financial year, thirty-one (31) outreach mobiles were launched in
various communities bringing access to services closer to where people live.
Over 30 000 community cases were referred to the relevant government
departments.
Small scale opportunities were realised through supporting 60 community based

Accredited municipal training was provided to municipal officials to ensure that
they have the relevant skills to support service delivery.
The Municipal Property Rates Act (MPRA) will support and provide advice and
guidance to municipal practitioners relating to challenges. It will also share best
practices.
The Department spearheaded a number of interventions aimed to strengthening
project planning pipelines in the Province.
These bulk infrastructure projects have
unlocked many housing projects which have contributed to improved access to
basic services.

FOREWORD BY THE MINISTER
Adv. Albert Fritz
Provincial Minister: Social Development
As the Western Cape Minister of Social Development, I am proud to have seen through
another financial year leading a department which continues to grow its services and expand
its reach, in a sustainable and stable manner.
The ever tougher economic and fiscal climate has meant that the Department had to
increasingly work smarter, and most importantly prioritise delivery on key services. As the
political head, I have placed an imperative that the Departments service delivery always
demonstrates measurable impact on communities, as a means of ensuring that the
Department of Social Development (DSD) can continuously monitor effectiveness, and
continuously improve.
Of course, measuring impact is also easier when the Department itself is guided by a set of
clear, coherent and measurable strategic outcomes, which assists the Department to deliver
on its many legislative and policy directives.
In this regard, the 5 Provincial Strategic Goals
(PSG), specifically PSG 2, which calls on the Department to: improve education outcomes and
opportunities for youth development, and PSG 3 which mandates us to: increasing wellness,
safety, and tackle social ills, is key.
This Annual Report allows DSD to evaluate just how much
progress the Department has made in this regard.
PSG 2 required that DSD direct its services
toward supporting, and where necessary, protecting young children in order to help them
prepare for and stay in school, and realise their rights to safety and adequate care.
In this regard, I am proud of the work that DSD has put in to train our social workers in different
specialised provisions of the Childrens Act.
In particular:
26 social workers were trained on the Safety and Risk Assessment Tool;
34 social workers were trained on adoptions as a permanent placement option for children
in need of care and protection; and
14 social workers were trained on mediation by the Family Mediators Association of the
Cape.
Given the challenges that have plagued the Department in relation to the administration of
the foster care system, I am proud to note that progress has been made.
The appointment of
a Foster Care Manager will go a long way in ensuring that we continuously improve this aspect
of the Departments delivery.
9
The Departments Child and Youth Care Centres (CYCCs) have improved their efficiency.
The centralised admissions system for children to CYCCs has also contributed to the more effective
management and placement of children.
PSG 2 further directed the Department to place emphasis on supporting youth beyond their
school years, to help bridge the gap from education into financial independence.
Read in
conjunction with the Provincial Youth Development Strategy (PYDS), the Department
achieved some notable developments this year.
The establishment of Youth Cafs remain a key priority for the Department.
The Youth Cafs
have proven to be very successful in providing targeted and meaningful services,
opportunities and support to thousands of young people across the province.
The sixth Youth
Caf was opened in Vrygrond in 2016.
A total of six Youth Cafs have been established in the
province since 2014 and I am proud to report that all are currently fully operational and
delivering on their mandates.
The Ministerial Youth Excellence Awards were held this year with
a total of 21 organisations being honoured for their outstanding contribution to youth
development, and five individuals for being role models to other youth.
Extending opportunities to youth was a big focus area this year.
I am proud of the 61 young people who
were part of the Youth Skills Transfer programme, and who progressed to eventually graduate
from the Business Incubation Programme.
The programme included a Youth Business Expo hosted by the Ministry.
PSG 3 required, among other things, that DSD provide psycho-social support services to reduce
harms related to social ills in the province. The Department focused on improving treatment
and related interventions for substance abuse.
The defining feature in the Departments fight
against substance abuse was the expansion of various services.
The Department expanded
the following: Outpatient treatment programme in CYCCs;
Adolescent matrix programme at schools in Kuilsriver, Eerste River, Steenberg, Lavender Hill,
Hout Bay and Elsies River;
Opioid replacement programme; and
The Departments interventions to protect older persons from abuse or neglect received a
major boost this year. I am proud to announce that DSD has established an Inspectorate,
which will tackle issues of elder abuse, and address human rights issues.
The Department
continued to prioritise the residential care facilities for frail older persons, and has made
and thus compliance with norms and standards in terms of the Older Persons Act.
The Departments care and support for victims of domestic violence received a boost this year,
Our shelters continue
to cater for victims of human trafficking.
These are just some of our achievements, and in this regard I would like to thank the Head of
Department (HOD), Dr Robert Macdonald, for his outstanding leadership of the Department.
Most importantly, as we look back on this financial year, I would like to thank every official in
the Department and our Non-Profit Organisation (NPO) partners, who work on the ground in
service of those most in need of our services.
As the
economy and fiscal climate continues to deteriorate, DSD will continue to build partnerships
and innovate.
We can achieve more if we continue to work Better Together.

REPORT OF THE ACCOUNTING OFFFICER
Dr Robert Macdonald
Accounting Officer: Social Development
Overview of the operations of the Department
For the last few years, the Department has been operating within an environment of increasing
resource constraints due to a reduced fiscal base and growing demand for essential services.
The Department has been applying austerity measures since 2013 and prioritising funding
toward direct service delivery.
An ongoing challenge that the Department has experienced
was to realise value for money via funding NPO services without compromising the viability of
these organisations.
It has worked towards this objective by increasing the subsidy allocation
for the salaries of social workers, social work supervisors and social work managers at funded
NPOs in the previous financial year and the provision of a 3% below inflationary rate increase,
as opposed to no increase, to funded NPOs.
The increased financial pressure required further
reduction of non-statutory services and prioritisation of statutory services such as child
protection.
Child protection is the single most important priority of the Department and is especially
necessary in light of the escalating violence against children.
The Department is working to
ensure that all children in need of care and protection receive quality services through
improving the capabilities of its social work staff.
To this end effort has been directed at
ensuring the existence of a 24-hour child protection service, implementing the Strategy for
Improvement of Child Care and Protection Services 2015 (CCPS), ensuring that all social work
staff are kept abreast of new developments in the field of child protection and are trained to
implement the Childrens Act.
This included the development of approved plans, Standard
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and accompanying training programmes in order to assist social
work staff with the implementation of their statutory duties.
Provision of psycho-social support
and counselling services to families, very young mothers, boys and fathers, and at risk parents
continued.
A special Early Childhood Development (ECD) programme for English language and cognitive
development where school readiness is poor was launched in April 2016, was piloted at ten
ECD sites in Khayelitsha, Delft and Philippi, and will be rolled out to a further 50 sites  including
rural areas - in 2017/18. It includes a mobile messaging application which provides parenting
and practitioner support programme at these sites.
Two media campaigns focused on raising
awareness of ECD.
The First 1000 Days mobile friendly site (a platform that facilitates ease of
was launched in collaboration with the Department of Health
(DoH) and highlighted the importance of the childs development during the period from
conception until their second birthday.
The second ECD campaign highlighted the
importance of partial care

The Department has taken the lead in the development of a Provincial Framework for Persons
with Intellectual Disabilities, to provide role clarity between the DSD, DoH and the Western
integration across the sector and the province was approved. A residential care facility for
children and adults with multiple disabilities was transferred from the DoH to the DSD on 1 April 2016.
A multi-pronged awareness campaign targeting persons with disabilities, their families
and caregivers was implemented using digital media, print media and radio focusing on
available services.
The Department has received an increase in unit costs from Provincial Treasury (PT) for frail
older persons in residential facilities, however the funding requirements for frail care are
disproportionately high in relation to the subsidy allocation and is therefore not sufficient to
Care for older persons, especially the expansion of independent and
assisted living, frail care and appropriate community-based interventions remain a priority for
the Department. This is effected through the funding of service centres, assisted living facilities
and residential care facilities.
A database for unfunded Community-based Care and Support
Services (service centres) was established to enable a holistic view of services, assist in
identifying gaps in the service delivery areas as well as addressing priority areas for the
allocation of future funding.
The Department has continued to focus on victim support; shelters for homeless adults
especially women and children, and special accommodation for victims of human trafficking;
probation services and diversion programmes.
A review of the Diversion Accreditation Policy
Framework commenced, while the system for tracking and monitoring all children in conflict
with the law who are in detention was implemented, thereby enabling the Department to
identify and address systemic and procedural blockages.
Five national diversion programmes
are operational and four provincial diversion programmes were accredited in the year under
review.
Accreditation of level two diversion programmes for girls at Vredelus CYCC is in process
in order to provide for this need.
A project in Hanover Park, Manenberg and Lavender Hill that
implements an intervention model with the aim of transforming communities devastated by
an aftercare project (184 children in three primary schools) and the youth in action project
as part of a comprehensive performance management system ensuring compliance with
norms and standards for CYCCs.
The Western Cape is the leading province in terms of full
registration of CYCCs providing secure care programmes to children and youth in
accordance with the Child Justice Act.
effective quality assurance process assisted in monitoring compliance with norms and
standards for secure care centres.
has been rolled out to funded NPO CYCCs that has assisted NPOs in the field to identify trends,
investigations and corrective/ development plans.
The structured interventions within Western
Cape DSD CYCCs for awaiting trial and sentenced youth are now used as a benchmark for
the Draft National Policy on gang management within secure care centres.
The Department has prioritised the upgrade of security at shelters for victims of crime and
violence, and has expanded services in areas where gang violence occurs. To ensure
implementation of the Prevention and Combatting of Human Trafficking Act, an internal
Act.

Bisexual Transgender and Intersex community were expanded, educational workshops for
men were conducted in areas with high prevalence of domestic violence, and therapeutic
and psycho-social victim support services were expanded to victims of gang violence.
The Department also piloted the first shelter in South
Africa specifically for adult victims of human trafficking and their children. Three shelters in the
Western Cape received recognition awards from the National DSD for the quality service that
they are rendering.
Progress in the field of substance abuse included the expansion of an adolescent school-
based outpatient programme in Elsies River; outpatient programmes in the rural areas of
Beaufort West and Ceres thereby expanding service delivery and improving accessibility; a
government-run inpatient substance abuse treatment centre for 30 female clients in
Kensington; provision of an inpatient substance abuse programme to 20 male adults and 16
(ROAR) Treatment Centre; and an inpatient treatment centre for 10 boys (age group: 13  15)
and 8 girls (age group: 13  17) at the Lindelani CYCC.
increased at two inpatient treatment facilities to improve accessibility, and a community-
abuse mobile friendly site was also developed. Interventions aligned to the Alcohol Harms Reduction Game Changer
include the development of an internal referral pathway for case management at DSD local offices which
is currently being piloted in Metro East, Metro South and Cape Winelands.
This will assist
communities to access alcohol-related early intervention and preventative services.
In addition, a SOP for high risk alcohol users has been developed in order to standardise
interventions in the three pilot regions.
Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were signed with
two schools in Metro East (Town Two Khayelitsha pilot site) cementing collaboration on
preventative strategies regarding harms related to alcohol abuse.
The Department and the
DoH have developed a composite resource directory of the three pilot sites to market the
alcohol-related services provided by various stakeholders in the area.
The Department finalised the Destitute Persons Burial Assistance Guide to provide a framework
for the Department to assist poor and vulnerable families who cannot bury their loved ones.
A DSD Disaster Management Plan 2017/18 was developed in collaboration with the Western
Cape Disaster Centre to clarify roles and responsibilities regarding disasters.

The Programme has spent 99.4% of its R50,092 million budget for the 2016/17 financial year.
The unspent funds of R321 thousand relate to an underspending in CoE due to not finding
suitable candidates in the recruitment process, internal promotions and staff exits.
Virements
The underspending on Goods and Services in Sub-programme 1.2 is due to the accrued
expense for the March account for Auditor-General fees only being paid in April 2017,
travel and subsistence due to further austerity measures on air travel, accommodation
and staff training due to the budget being supplemented by the Health and Welfare
Sector Education Training Authority (HWSETA).
The funds will be utilised to augment the
shortfall within Sub-programme 4.2 for clothing and uniforms to clients and staff in DSD
CYCCs, property payments, agency and outsourced services at Horizon and Clanwilliam;
The underspending on CoE in Sub-programme 2.1 is due to internal promotions, not finding
suitable candidates and filling of prioritised posts in Sub-programme 3.3 and 3.4.
The underspending on Transfers and Subsidies in Sub-programme 2.3 is due to non-
compliant NPOs (non-submission of audited financial statements).
The funds will be used
to offset the shortfall in Sub-programme 4.2 for agency and outsourced services for
Horizon and Clanwilliam; and
The underspending on Transfers and Subsidies in Sub-programme 3.4 is due to non-
compliant NPOs (non-submission of progress reports and/or audited financial statements).
The funds will be utilised to augment the shortfall within Sub-programme 4.2 for agency
and outsourced services
for
maintenance and repairs at own facilities from the Goods and Services budget and Sub-
programme 5.6 for Transfer and Subsidies for Youth interventions.

Rollovers
The Department applied for roll over and the retention of revenue amounting to R1,355
million.
This will be utilised as follows:
The roll-over of R240 thousand is for the After School Game Changer where funds were
only committed once the post audit follow up process was completed.
The aim was to
ensure standardisation of attendance monitoring systems for after school facilities and
Mass participation; Opportunity and access; Development and growth (MOD) centres.
Much effort was placed on ensuring a working biometric system.
As the system proved
to be challenging for MOD centres, the DSD biometrics project was cancelled and the
funds were reprioritised for training and capacity building, hence the submission and
contract with Partners Afterschool Care Projects (PASCAP) service organisation.
The
funds will be spent in the 2017/18 financial year.

facilitate the acquisition of police clearance certificates and facilitate accredited home
based care training;
access for an early intervention service for deaf children; and
children to and from the centre.

Future plans of the Department
In line with our determination to continuously improve the implementation of service delivery
related statutory requirements, the Department will support and increase opportunities for
children and youth.
In this regard the Department will continue to roll out the Provincial Early
Childhood Development Strategy.
This strategy has already seen the development of a
ground-breaking pilot special ECD programme for English
language and cognitive
development, set to grow in the next financial year.
The Department will also continue to be
involved in the After School Game Changer which will provide the spaces children need to
engage in positive developmental activities.
Through the PYDS, the Department will ensure that programmes for young people are
sustainable and have a meaningful impact on their lives, especially as it relates to reducing
youth unemployment.
In terms of the Departmental mandate, the strategic focus is to ensure
that the needs of the most vulnerable and at risk young people in the province are prioritised
while also providing services, opportunities and support to a cross section of young people. To
this end Departmental initiatives are aimed at improving the quality of youth development
outcomes, particularly by ensuring that all of DSD youth targeted programmes are geared
towards channelling young people into opportunities that improve their job prospects, skills
levels and overall life chances.
The Department will seek to build on and improve the quality
of all programmes that target young people, particularly programmes such as the Youth
Cafs.
In this regard the Department will pay attention to ensuring that the Expanded Public
Works Programme (EPWP) is more efficiently utilised as a source of economic opportunity and
skills development for young people.
The Department will also focus on the inclusion of youth
with disabilities, with specific emphasis on creating improved linkages to economic
opportunities and better quality services for youth with disabilities.
A transversal approach is important as the economic climate continues to place pressure on
the Departments resources and ability to deliver.
The Department will continue to focus on
strengthening the family through the Family-at-Risk project.
The project will focus on essential
services to families at greatest risk, and move toward services aimed more at medium risk cases
as these essential cases/services are stabilised.
Execution of this project is partially dependent
on external stakeholders in the Child Care and Protection, and Family Law systems, including
the Family Court, Childrens Court, the South African Police Service (SAPS), and the Office of
the Family Advocate.
The Department will work on building cooperation with these role
players.
The Departmental focus regarding the Alcohol Harms Reduction Game Changer will be on
expanding the community-based model for substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation.
Our major focus, in partnership with the DoH, will be to establish a Brief Motivational
Intervention (BMI) at emergency centres in the targeted areas, providing high risk users that
have an alcohol-related injury with the necessary support and assistance.
The BMI service will
have a concrete referral pathway process to ensure that once high risk users are discharged
from health facilities, they are able to access appropriate social services.
In this regard, we will
coordinate our community programmes, and streamline the referral systems amongst all our
partners within all spheres of government and NPO sectors.
In addition, the Department will
continue the work of growing the number of rehabilitation services aimed at addressing the
psycho-social effects of alcohol and drugs.

Annual Report for 2016/17 Financial Year |Vote 7: Department of Social Development | Province of the Western Cape
Discontinued activities
The closure of the state run Level 2 Tenderten CYCC for children aged 5  12 years.
The
reasons for closure are as follows:
Level 2 care according to the Strategy on the Provision of Child and Youth Care
Centres falls within the ambit of an NPO CYCC; and
The over-provision of these CYCCs in the Metro South area.
All staff have been re-deployed within the Department as directed in the union
agreement.
Final matching and placing is in process and all residents have been placed
within the adequate level of care at NPO CYCCs.
The funding that was made available because of this reprioritisation was used to establish
additional needed secure care (Level 3) bedspace at Lindelani and the provisioning of
the Kraaifontein ROAR and Treatment Centre.
New or proposed activities
New activities for this reporting period are as follows:
Establishment of the Kraaifontein ROAR and Treatment Centre;
The transfer of the Sivuyile facility for persons with intellectual disabilities from the DoH
Increased secure care bedspace at Lindelani; and
as of 1 April 2016.
The need for an increase in secure care bed-space was required due to more children on
the streets and escalating social issues such as gang violence etc.
Therefore, Lindelani,
which was previously a ROAR centre, now also became a secure care centre for children
with challenging behaviour and a ROAR centre for boys was established at the
Kraaifontein ROAR and Treatment Centre;
Sivuyile was transferred to the Department as per the approved Cabinet Submission of
2015 and related to the Right to Education Court Case for People with Intellectual
Disabilities.
The Department is responsible for coordination and facilitation on issues of
intellectual disabilities; and
There was no additional cost regarding the establishment of the Kraaifontein ROAR centre
and increased secure care bed-space at Lindelani since the budget that became
available with the closure of Tenderten was re-prioritised for the purposes of establishing
the ROAR centre.
In the case of Sivuyile, the DoH transferred the budget and in addition
all staff (including the nursing staff) were absorbed.
Supply Chain Management (SCM)
Unsolicited bid proposals concluded for the year under review
The Department has not concluded any unsolicited bid proposal agreements during the year
under review.
SCM processes and systems in place to prevent irregular expenditure
The Accounting Officers System (AOS) that regulates SCM and movable asset management
functions is in place. This policy speaks to and sets out the policy aspects.
It regulates
institutional and administrative actions in day-to-day SCM operations.
Challenges experienced in SCM and how they were resolved
Monitoring the implementation of the AOS has been a challenge.
With the advent of the
supply chain governance, the Department has performed assessments to determine the
extent to which it has adhered to prescribed SCM practices for supply chain performance in
19 Annual Report for 2016/17 Financial Year |Vote 7: Department of Social Development | Province of the Western Cape
the Department.
Special interventions were conducted to address gaps that were identified.
Capacity building forms part of the plan to improve performance and adherence to legislative
requirements or prescripts.
The implementation of strategic sourcing has generated some benefits.
However, it had its
own distinct challenges inter alia budget constraints and change in business strategies.

Appreciation and Conclusion
On behalf of the senior management of the Department, I would like to thank all DSD staff,
particularly those working at the coalface of service delivery, for their ongoing dedication to
serving the public.
I would also like to thank all the NPO partner organisations that have
provided quality services to the public on behalf of the Department, especially in a very
difficult economic environment, which has seen both an increased demand for social services
and poverty alleviation, and a reduced flow of state funding and corporate social investment
from the private sector.

persons in the category 60 years and older.
33
520 785 persons aged 60 years and older.
Recent population projections indicate that the
population of persons older than 60 will grow by a further 35% between 2011 and 2020. The
fastest growing population of older persons is in areas that traditionally did not have a large
proportion of older persons.
There is therefore a mismatch between where services for older
persons are located and where the growing need is.
The 73% growth in the older persons aged
85 years and older has significant implications for the provisioning and support of frail care
services for older persons.
Care for older persons, especially the expansion of independent
and assisted living, frail care and appropriate community-based interventions remain a priority
for the Department.
This is effected through the funding of service centres, assisted living
facilities and residential care facilities.
Research regarding an evaluation of service centres for
older persons concluded in the previous year presented valuable insight for the potential
development of an integrated community-based care model within the continuum of care.
The Western Cape is home to 2,1 million youth between the ages of 15 and 34 years.
Using the
Census 2011 data, it has been calculated that 13% of these youth (approximately 277 160) can
be classified as not in employment, education or training (NEETs).
In addition, more than 60%
Key findings of the
research regarding NEETs in the province highlight the negative impact of violent crime,
substance abuse and gangsterism on the socialisation of young people. This coupled with the
weak South African economy and the lack of employment opportunities has led to high
demand for services to youth, but little in the way of exit strategies for youth in skills
programmes. Therefore, key priorities of the Department over the MTEF period are to ensure
that all Departmental youth-focused programmes are aligned with the longterm outcomes
of the PYDS and that there is a strategic focus on NEETs.
In addition, the Department has strived,
in conjunction with the youth sector, to align NPO youthtargeted programmes with PYDS
outcomes.
Likewise, the Department in collaboration with the Department of the Premier
(DotP) has worked towards ensuring the transversal alignment and implementation of youth-
targeted programmes across all provincial departments.
The PYDS has been implemented and six Youth Cafs are operational and designed to provide
vibrant, positive spaces where young people are afforded opportunities to access skills
development programmes, training workshops, seminars, and entrepreneurial opportunities.
Further opportunities for youth were also provided by the EPWP and during the reporting year,
The incidence of social crime in the Western Cape remains a priority issue owing to its
deleterious impact on the provinces social and economic wellbeing.
The most significant
increase in reported crime in the province occurred in the drug related crime category, with
an increase of 156,3% in the period between 2005 and 2015. These and other social ills continue
to increase at a faster rate than the growth of the population.
A clearer picture of the
incidence of drug related crimes in the Western Cape emerges when it is examined by ratio
of the population.
At 1 431 per 100 000 persons for the period 2014/15, the Western Cape was
the province with the highest rate of drug related crime.
In the same year, the provinces
incidence rate was 292% higher than the national incidence rate of 490 per 100 000.
Departmental research on reported cases of domestic violence indicates an 18% increase
between 2007 and 2010.
In line with its mandate, the Department has continued to focus on

2.3 Organisational environment
The Social Welfare and Business Planning and Strategy chief directorates, together with the
corporate services units of the Departments six regional offices, were the subject of
organisational design processes during 2016/17.
Implementation is scheduled to begin in the
next financial year.
With respect to the former, the focus was on the creation of additional
capacity within the Directorate: Special Programmes to deliver services for Persons with
Disabilities, specifically those with severe intellectual disability in light of the transfer of this
function from the DoH and; the provision of additional capacity in the form of a quality
assurance unit in the Directorate: Facility Management and Quality Monitoring.
This will ensure
that services provided within departmental and NPO funded CYCCs are delivered according
to statute.
In the case of the Chief Directorate: Business Planning and Strategy, its
microstructure was subject to the organisational design process to provide for more effective
policy alignment, knowledge management and corporate governance of ICT services within
the Department.
implementation of the Departmental Strategy for the Improvement of Child Care and
Protection Services will result in the provision of additional administration support at service
delivery office level.
This will free up social service professionals for more intensive social work
supervision and thus effective grassroots service delivery and will enable the Department to
meet its statutory obligations regarding Childrens Court processes, alternative care,
rights and responsibilities, marriage counselling and parenting skills  all of which are critical
social work interventions. Business Processes

ensuring the quality of service delivery.
This is underpinned by continuous training and the
implementation of the 2011 Supervision Framework for the Social Work Profession in South
Africa.
With respect to its support services, the Department continued to refine its performance
information management processes through the piloting of a second level performance
Performance Information SOP and the Indicator Description Manual (IDM).
The successes of
these measures are evidenced by the fact that over the past MTEF period, the Auditor-General
South Africa (AGSA) reported an unqualified conclusion on the usefulness and reliability of the
Departments reported performance information.
With respect to its SCM processes, the Department continued to implement strategic sourcing
a collaborative and structured process that critically analyses its spending and using the
information to make effective business decisions about acquiring commodities and services
in response to the NDPs differentiated approach to procurement.
This coupled with the review
of the Departments SCM structure and concise guidelines for implementation will ensure an
efficient well-resourced SCM system.

IT systems play a vital part in the efficient operation of the Department.
To this end the
Department continues to ensure that ICT governance and systems administration processes
and procedures are in place and operational.

The system is expected to improve efficiencies in the payment of transfer
funding to NPOs by automating compliance checking of payment documents such as
approved NPO reports, financial statements and TPAs.
In addition, management information
relating to spread of funded services coupled with information on the location of vulnerable
groups served by the Department enables focused service delivery.
The NPO Management
System will replace many manual procedures, reduce duplication caused by the current
manual system and replace many MS Excel based reports and databases currently in use for
reporting and compliance checking purposes.
A challenge in the technological environment is the constrained fiscal environment in the
province and Department.
The Department will continue to implement measures to mitigate
some of the effects of the provincial budget cuts envisaged over the MTEF period, by
extending its ICT refresh beyond the DSD mandatory five-year period, and accessing potential
sources of funding within PT and the national department.

units within the Department who deal with the public are more accessible.

The Western Cape is the leading province in terms of full registration of
CYCCs providing secure care programmes to children and youth in terms
of the Child Justice Act.
Implementation of risk plans for all centres and an
effective quality assurance process assisted in monitoring compliance with
norms and standards for secure care centres.
It includes registered Adult
Education Centres at all centres managed by qualified education staff.
To ensure implementation of the Prevention and Combatting of Human
Trafficking Act the Department established an internal Human Trafficking
Task Team to assist with the implementation of the Act.
Educational workshops for men were conducted in areas with high
prevalence of domestic violence, and therapeutic as well as psycho-social
victim support services were expanded to victims of gang violence. A
referral protocol has been developed to ensure that services to victims are
coordinated.
Shelter space for male victims of violence and crime was piloted to
develop a baseline for the need for male shelters in Cape Town. The
Department piloted the first shelter in South Africa, specifically for adult
victims of human trafficking and their children and three shelters in the
Western Cape received recognition awards by NDSD for the quality service
that they are rendering.
Progress in the field of substance abuse included the expansion of an
adolescent school-based outpatient programme in Elsies River and
outpatient programmes in the rural areas of Beaufort West and Ceres to
expand service delivery and improve accessibility.
The digital substance abuse campaign extended its reach by broadening
the target audience, refining channels, and the introduction of new elements.

Venture Creation (SMME) to build the capacity of people with disabilities
by providing accredited training.
A draft Sustainable Livelihoods Operations Procedure Manual was

Programme achievements
A campaign on the registration of ECD Partial Care sites was launched with a web page highlighting the importance of partial care registration
and the benefits for children and parents /care givers.
The establishment of a special ECD programme for English language, cognitive development and a pilot programme was implemented at
ten of these sites.
A mobile messaging application which includes parenting and practitioner support programmes was implemented.
Through the After School Game Changer project, 87 DSD funded After School Partial Care facilities were externally audited following a self-
audit process and this has enabled the identification of specific sites for targeted capacity building. Strategy to overcome areas of under performance
A new registration model was introduced by NDSD (that will categorise facility registration as bronze, silver or gold) looking at relaxation of some of the
municipal requirements and conditionally register/re-register facilities.
This conditional registration will enable these ECD facilities to continue rendering
a service while in the process of becoming fully compliant.

This integrated initiative
solidifies socio-economic interventions to reduce recidivism.
The Western Cape is the leading province in terms of full registration of CYCCs providing secure care programmes to children and youth in
terms of the Child Justice Act.
Implementation of risk plans for all centres and an effective quality assurance process assisted in monitoring
compliance with norms and standards for secure care centres.
It includes registered Adult Education Centres at all facilities, managed by
qualified education staff.
Capacity building on norms and standards, and improved monitoring and reporting process has resulted in increased NPO compliance.
Strategy to overcome areas of under performance
Stakeholder engagements with Department of Justice, National Prosecuting Authority, SAPS and individual magistrates with the objective of
unblocking the slow movement of children in the system.

Programme achievements
The Population Unit focused on the mapping of areas of operation for NPOs providing child care and protection services in the Western Cape
Province.
This was done to assist the Department in identifying gaps/overlaps in service delivery in each of the SDAs.
Estimates of the Western Cape fertility rates at sub-provincial level utilising census, statistics, South Africas live births data, health and other
fertility related data sources available in the province were compiled at district and municipal levels to develop provincial and municipal
strategic planning.

TRANSFER PAYMENTS 5.
5.1 Transfer payments to public entities
Not applicable
5.2 Transfer payments to all organisations other than public entities
Please see enclosed CD.
The Department monitors the transfer payment process in the following ways:
Each programme has a monitoring plan for each NPO that it funds which include site visits;
Compliance is monitored according to the TPA which contains all the targets and the
funding conditions;
Funding meetings have been institutionalised as an additional tool to monitor programme
TPAs; and
The performance information management processes (including reporting templates,
SOPs and an indicator description manual) have been revised to ensure that the data
collected is reliable, valid and that the data sets are complete.
The major challenge and difficulty experienced with the transfer payment process is that the
Department previously transferred funds on a quarterly basis to the NPOs.
On instruction from
the Provincial Treasury, payments have been processed monthly since September 2016 in
order to project cash flows more accurately.
Processing monthly payments to more than 2 000
NPOs has caused a tremendous administrative burden for the Department and this has led to
some NPOs not receiving payments on time.
With the development and implementation of the NPO Management System the Department
should be able to address these issues.

One of the cornerstones of the Staff Performance Management System (SPMS) is the basic
requirement that all employees are obliged to do what is expected of them.
These
expectations and the required performance standards are concretised by means of job
descriptions, performance agreements and business / operational plans. Rewards and
incentives are therefore only granted for work that qualitatively and quantitatively surpasses
work for which employees are remunerated.
Employees who are nominated for performance bonuses are assessed by moderation panels,
who then examine the evidence of superior performance.
Under-performing staff members,
on the other hand, are required to complete the actions stipulated in a Performance
Improvement Plan.
These are closely monitored to ensure absolute compliance with
acceptable performance standards.
The framework also seeks to promote a positive workplace culture that encourages formal
and informal discussions about performance quality, lead practice and continuous individual
improvement.
This system sets the framework in which both the employer and employee can equally realise
their goals and objectives to ensure the achievement of PSG 5, namely to Embed good

Job evaluation
equally.
Within a nationally determined framework, executing authorities are required to
evaluate each new post in his or her organisation or re-evaluate any post where the post
mandate or content has significantly changed.
This job evaluation process determines the
grading and salary level of a post.
It should be understood that Job Evaluation and Staff
Performance Management differ in the sense that Job Evaluation refers to the value/weighting
of the activities that are associated with the post and Staff Performance Management refers
to the review of an individuals performance.
Table 3.3.1 summarises the number of posts that were evaluated during the year under review.
The table also provides statistics on the number of posts that were upgraded or downgraded.

7: Western Cape Department of Social Development
Report on the audit of the financial statements
Opinion
1.
2.
I have audited the financial statements of the Western Cape Department of Social
Development set out on pages 161 to 225, which comprise the appropriation statement,
position of the Western Cape Department of Social Development as at 31 March 2017,

5.
I conducted my audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs).
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of my report.
I am independent of the department in accordance with the International Ethics
and the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit in South Africa.
I have
fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the
IESBA code.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for my opinion.
Other matter
6.
I draw attention to the matter below.
7.
The supplementary information set out on pages 226 to 236 does not form part of the
financial statements and is presented as additional information.

error. 9. In preparing the financial statements, the accounting officer is responsible for assessing the
Western Cape Department of Social Developments ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the intention is to liquidate the
department or cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

10.
My objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an auditors report that includes my opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the ISAs
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis
of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the ISAs, I exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional scepticism throughout my audit of the financial statements, and the

Financial statements
auditors report, I also:
identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
my opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the departments internal control
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the accounting officer
conclude on the appropriateness of the accounting officers use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements.
I also conclude, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Western Cape
Department of Social Developments ability to continue as a going concern.
If I
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my
auditors report to the related disclosures in the financial statements about the material
uncertainty or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify the opinion on the
financial statements.
My conclusions are based on the information available to me at
the date of the auditors report.
However, future events or conditions may cause a
department to cease operating as a going concern
evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Communication with those charged with governance
4.
I communicate with the accounting officer regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.
I also confirm to the accounting officer that I have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to have a bearing on my independence and
where applicable, related safeguards.

FOREWORD
Western Cape Minister of Social Development
This APP is guided by provincial policy priorities and strategic objectives, national
legislative requirements and provincial
legislative
requirements and takes into account the latest census data on socio-economic
needs and challenges in the province.
These priorities continue to overlap and should be collectively used to support a
common goal, rather than be competing for implementation.
As a province, we will
focus on what is most relevant and urgent in terms of the needs and socio-economic
circumstances of the people living in the Western Cape.
The Department of Social Development (DSD) has aligned itself with the overall
outcomes and goals of the National Development Plan (NDP).
The NDP focuses on a
reduction in poverty and inequality and diagnosed a number of areas for
intervention.
with that of the Provincial strategic Objective (PSO) 8: i.e. Increasing social inclusion
and reducing poverty. In particular the NDP speaks about divided communities and
the need for Social Protection (Chapter 11), together with Transforming Society
and Uniting the Country (Chapter 15) and Improving Education, Training and
Innovation (Chapter 9).
PSO8 calls upon us to look at all of our social policies with the following question in
mind: Is this policy the best possible way to promote sustainable social inclusion and
poverty reduction for its targeted beneficiaries?
This objective covers the following priorities:
Strengthening families
Early childhood development (ECD)
Youth
Vulnerable groups
Preventing and reducing violence
Increasing participation in civic life ii
I remain determined to increase opportunities for youth development, to ensure that
programmes for these citizens are sustainable, and have meaningful impact on their
lives, specifically with regard to reducing youth unemployment.
To this end our newly
developed youth strategy seeks to help young people to become economically
selfsufficient and independent, healthy, with positive family, personal and social
relationships, and should be active in their community.
In pursuing these outcomes
for young people the strategy identifies a wide range of services, programmes, and
support systems that will ensure they have access to the kinds of opportunities they
need for their own development.
Furthermore, we remain focused on extending quality ECD, where clearly defined
learning programmes are implemented, to as many children as possible.
Helping
young people, from an early age, to develop socially, cognitively, and physically is
probably the most valuable investment that governments can make to drive social
inclusion and reduce poverty.
The family unit, child care, ECD, and sustained formal
education are at the heart of this.
We also remain challenged to fight violence in our society, and in particular to
address the underlying social issues that give rise to violence.
Our intervention
programmes to create alternatives for young people, in a way that allows them to
channel their energy into positive initiatives, will continue.
Reducing drug and alcohol related harms across the province are a priority not only
for this department, but the entire Western Cape Government.
We recognize the
enormity of the challenge and are committed to pooling our resources to ensure
maximum impact in the lives of those most in need of services.
We will continue to expand our Victim Empowerment (VEP) services so that we are
able to reach more vulnerable women and children in need of care and support in
their quest to overcome trauma.
In terms of improving organizational development, accuracy and usefulness of
reporting data
remains a priority
for the department.
Obtaining accurate
performance information from over 2000 NGOs and 34 local service delivery offices is
iii
a significant challenge for the department as reflected in previous annual reports.
However, it is crucial to ensure that the public funds utilized for these services are
producing maximum benefits for the poor and vulnerable communities of the
Western Cape.
Finally, this APP is guided by the Childrens Act, Child Justice Act and Older Persons
Act, as well as the Provincial Education Act, all of which have resource implications
for the DSD.
Responding to the scale of social challenges in our rapidly changing province will
remain a daunting task.
It will demand our full collective efforts going forward, and I
trust that this APP, underpinned by PSO8, will ensure that our priorities are balanced,
progressive and have maximum impact on the lives of the people we serve.

Draft Stakeholder Management Framework Western Cape, DSD.
This Framework
guides the provincial Departments interaction with a range of stakeholders in
delivering its social welfare and community development services.
5 Updated Situational Analysis
5.1 Performance Delivery Environment
An analysis of Census 2011 population data of the Western Cape indicates key
trends in the size and structure of the provinces population that should be
considered in the planning of services for vulnerable groups that fall within the scope
and mandate of the Departments services.
These trends include an increase of
28,7% in the size of the provinces population from 4,524,335 in 2001 to 5,822,734 in
2011, with the biggest increases occurring in the age groups 0-4 and 20-29. This
increase suggests a need for the expansion of the network of services provided by
the Department in order to accommodate a greater number of people who may
require social development services.
Census 2011 data further indicate that the population and gender composition of
the province did not change significantly between the two Censuses.
However, an
analysis of this nature can easily mask hidden inequalities and vulnerability.
For
example, in terms of gender, 49% of people enumerated in the Census were male,
and 51% were female.
Although the gender distribution in the province appears to
be almost equal, further analysis of factors such as employment status and status of
heads of households highlight inequalities that can contribute to the vulnerability of
women in particular population groups.
Male heads of household are earning higher
annual incomes than females.
Census 2011 indicates that more males (54.36%) than
females (45.64%) are employed.
This has implications for the caregiving ability of
women in the province, many of whom are single parents.
The age breakdown of the provinces population, as reported in Census 2011
indicate that there are 1,739,425 children between the ages of 0 and 17 years in the
province, and 2,137,820 youth between the ages of 15 and 34 years.
32% (1,838,294)
are children below the age of 19, while 37% (2,137,821) are youth in the age
category 15 to 34 years.
69,4% of the provinces population is under the age of 40
years.
The predominantly youthful structure of the provincial population and the
increase in the 0-4 age group as well as the 20-29 age group between the two
Censuses, could indicate the need for an expansion of child protection, ECD and
youth developmental services.
The distribution of the provincial population remained constant since 2001 with the
majority (64,2%) of the population residing in the Cape Town Metro, followed by the
Cape Winelands (13,5%), Eden (9,9%), West Coast (6,7%) and Overberg (4,4%).
The
Although the majority of the
population reside in the Cape Metro, changes in social and population dynamics
(for example, population ageing) as well as social pathologies in areas outside the
Metro must be considered in the planning of services. Information collected by the
Departments Research Unit during 2012/13, highlighted disturbing trends in the
spread and emergence of social challenges typically associated with urban regions
of the province, into outlying areas.
These trends include increases in child
maltreatment, substance abuse, gangsterism and youth in conflict with the law in
outlying areas.
number of households in the province by 35,2% or from 1,208,987 in Census 2001 to
adequately provide for their members, For example, in 2011, the expanded
unemployment rate in the province was 26,71% while 13,3% of households reported
not having any income.
Many households also lack basic resources such as housing
to provide for their members as is illustrated by an increase from 3,4% to 6,4% in the
category of informal dwellings/shack in backyard in the recent Census.
Many
families also face a significant burden of care, for example, in the 2011 Census it was
found that 10,4% of household members are grandchildren.
Consideration should also be given to social trends for vulnerable groups and social
pathologies as described in detail under the Departments respective Programmes
in this document.
Key and interrelated trends that require special consideration
include a consistent increase in drug related crime as well as an increase in various
categories of social crimes that affect the safety and security of residents of the
province.
Of particular concern is an escalating trend in child maltreatment in the
province that is exacerbated by the socio-economic vulnerability of households in
which many children reside.
An indication of the vulnerability of children, is the finding of Census 2011 that 19,645
children are reported to have lost both their mother and father and that there are
3,482 child headed households in the province.
The number of children living in
income poverty (households with monthly per capita income less than R604) in the
province  31,8% in 2011/12, should also be addressed in order to prevent neglect
The
General Household Survey of 2011 also found that 14, 7% of children in the province
were living in households without an employed adult.
Support should also be
provided to children living in households where there is reported child hunger
15,8% in 2010.
Crime trends that are of particular concern, include the 311.5% increase in drug
related crime in the period between April 2003 and March 2013 in the province. This
trend is of particular concern due to the link between substance abuse and various
social pathologies such as family and community violence as well as child

maltreatment.
In addition, In 2012/13, the Western Cape had the second highest
murder rate of all provinces as well as the highest rate of attempted murder and
second highest for common assault.
The province also had the third highest rate of
sexual assault of all provinces at a rate of 148,6 persons per 100,000 of the
population.
Crime occurring at a highly interpersonal and household level, namely
domestic violence, increased by 18% (number of reported cases) in the period 2007
to 2010  in 2010, 21,383 cases were reported (Western Cape DSD, 2013).
These
trends are of concern as it appears to be indicative of social trends that are
escalating, and spreading regardless of current service delivery interventions.
5.2 Organisational Environment
The DSD modernisation programme initiated in 2010 focused on streamlining
Departmental operations to ensure efficient and effective service delivery. This
included the modernisation of the organisational structure; accessibility of services;
business processes, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) systems.
These initiatives support the fulfilling of the departmental mandates, thus contributing
towards the Provincial Strategic Objective No. 12 namely, being the best run
regional government in the world.

The position of Head of Department is vacant and is envisaged that it will be filled in
the 2014/15 financial year. Dr Robert Macdonald is currently acting in this position.
The modernised CFO structure has been approved and the matching and placing
process will be concluded in the 2013/14 financial year and critical vacancies will be
advertised and filled during the 2014/15 financial year.
As required by the Public Service Act and Regulations the Department is in the
process of assessing its human resources capacity at Head Office specifically
related to Social Welfare Services, Children and Families and Restorative Services
sub-programmes as well as Community Development.
The organisational structure for Child and Youth care centres (CYCCs)  Level 3 and
4 Secure Care was approved during the 2013/14 financial year.
The approved
11
structure is aligned to national norms and standards and the national blue print for
Youth Care Centres.
It also made provision for special treatment centres for the
assessment and stabilisation of volatile youth behaviour.
The national norm for social workers for a province for the provision of generic
community based and residential services is 1:4,500 of the population.
In terms of the
Modernisation Blueprint, the Department will employ half the social workers and
subsidise the other half at NPOs delivering community based and residential care
services.
The current DSD organisational structure has 588 funded and approved
social work posts on the staff establishment of regional offices.
This number is based
on the population size of the province as recorded in the 2007 Community Survey.
Based on Census 2011, the Western Cape requires 1,294 social work posts, 647 of
which should be on the DSD establishment.
Thus we would have to work towards
funding an additional 59 posts for these teams, while also funding an additional 59
posts in the NPO sector.

The modernisation blueprint created an organisational structure that replaced 16
district offices with 6 regional offices and 45 local offices and together with the staff
matching and placing processes, was designed to bring services closer to
communities.
33 of the 45 local offices are currently fully operational. The following
new service delivery offices are planned for 2014/15: Clanwilliam (Cedarburg
, Retreat and Fish Hoek (City of Cape Town municipality), Ceres
(Witzenburg municipality) and Bredasdorp (Cape Agulhas municipality).
Two regional offices (Metro East and Eden Karoo) will be relocated from their current
spaces to new office accommodation.
ICT Systems
The modernisation of the DSD technological environment was kick-started through a
four year IT refresh project to replace all IT equipment in the Department.
Over the
past three years the refresh project was rolled out and completed in six regions.
The
Departments head office and facilities is the focus in the current financial year
(2013/14).
The refresh has resulted in a growth in the use of ICT and Information
systems and necessitated a systematic upgrade of the Departments network
bandwidth.
In addition, offices in the Metro are being linked to the Citys fibre optic
network.
The refresh project will be repeated in a four year cycle.

The DSD will be prioritising the development of two ICT systems during the MTEF
period:
Enterprise Content Management  MyContent: The Department has introduced
OpenText Content Server (LiveLink) into the Department to manage Departmental
documents and content as well as the associated business processes.
As the
department implements the electronic work processes it is expected that the need
for additional automated business processes will increase to promote greater
efficiencies in the Department.
It is also expected that OpenText Content Server be
integrated with other systems such as SDIMS (Social Development Information
Management System) and the Social Work Diary System.
DSD NPO Management System: Ce-I have just concluded a high level Business
Analysis of the DSD NPO Management and Funding Process and the Department will
now begin to automate the process.
The new system will be built in separate but
integrated modules over a number of years.
In April 2012, the Department adopted and
implemented the Corporate
Governance Review Outlook (CGRO) with the aim to systematically achieve higher
levels of governance maturity over the medium to long-term.
Its objectives are to
practices and promotes best practice.
The previous Financial Governance Review
and Outlook (FGRO) and Financial Management
Improvement Plan (FMIP)
processes have been collapsed into a Governance Action Plan (GAP) owned and
championed by Accounting Officers.
The intention is to attain a clean audit, which is
full compliance (conformance) with the laws and regulations and defined internal
control processes.
Performance information management processes have been revised to ensure that
the data collected is reliable and valid and that the data sets are complete.
This has
resulted in the following changes to the performance management system:
A reduction in the number as well as refinement of the programme performance
indicators for 2013/14.
The same indicators will be used during 2014/15.
This will
improve performance data measurability over the period. 14

performance information collection and collation hubs by the centralisation of
these processes and safeguarding in the social welfare service and community
partnership development programme offices in the offices of sub-programme
budget holders thereby ensuring the point of truth and accountability.
As part of the PSO 10 Integrated Development Plan (IDP) Indaba workgroup, the
Department has contributed to the objective of integrated government delivery by
facilitating the drafting of Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) with the 4 district
municipalities (Eden, West Coast, Cape Winelands and Central Karoo) and 4 local
Municipalities
(Bergriver, Matzikama, Prince Albert and Knysna).
Draft
implementation plans have been completed for six of the municipalities.
Currently
the department is participating in the institutionalisation of IDP and budgeting which
involves capacity building of DSD personnel on IDP, participating in all District
Coordinating Forums (DCFs) as well as IDP Indaba and assessment processes.
The following working agreements are already operational:
o Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the City of Cape Town in respect of
the rendering of Social Services;
Service Level Agreement (SLA) with the Department of the Premier (DotP) in
respect of the Corporate Service Centre, ICT, HR, Internal Audit, Enterprise risk
management and Forensic services;
o
SLA with SASSA in respect of office accommodation; foster care; social relief and
information management systems;
SLA with Public Works and Transport in respect of accommodation and user
asset management plan and Government Motor Transport (GMT);
SLA with Department of Community Safety in respect of crime prevention,
security, health and safety issues;
o MOU with the Department of Health in respect of Older Persons, Substance
Abuse and Persons with Disabilities; and o
SLA with Sea Harvest Corporation in the West Coast which cements commitment
with the private sector to overcome social ills facing communities. 15
5.3 Strategic Planning Process
Departmental Strategic Planning Process
First draft
The first draft APP was informed by an analysis of national and provincial DSD
policies and priorities; a trend and situational analysis of the operating
environment; a review of past performance; the determination of programme
imperatives and its aligning with fiscal constraints and indicative resource
allocations.
Planning meetings were held with each DSD sub-programme and focussed on:
o Review of progress against 2010-2015 strategic plan;
o Review of achievements during 2012/13;
o Implications of national and Provincial priorities for programmes; and
o Ensuring a link between the situational analyses, programme foci, indicators
and targets.
Ministerial and Management Committee approval of APP
Second draft
The second draft of the APP was refined through:
A MTEC presentation where performance against goals was analysed, the issues
that would impact on the Medium Term Expenditure was noted and alignment
with the NDP, ONECAPE2040 and PSO linkages were highlighted.
A management discussion
in November 2013 where key decisions on
programme priorities, reprioritisation and its impact on the budget for the
planned year were taken.
The HOD took the decision to maintain the 2013/14 sector indicators.
This
decision was informed by the following:
o DSD undertaking to the NPO sector that the performance indicators would
not change for at least two years because changing indicators would
require DSD to modify over 2 000 contracts.
It would also require redefining
supporting documentation required for audit purposes;
o DSD had made similar undertakings to the provincial parliamentary Portfolio
Committee on Community Development and to the Standing Committee
on Public Accounts (SCOPA), because these bodies raised concerns about
16 the constant changing of indicators, which made it impossible to establish
baselines and track the progress of the Department over more than one
financial year; o Each time indicators are changed; new baselines and targets have to be
developed.
This compromises the MTEC process; and
o DSD will include the new sector indicators in its APP and Quarterly
Performance Reports, but will not be able to set or report against targets.
A planning workshop was held on the 18th November 2013 with programme and
regional management.
The objective being to ensure that the targets set are
realistic and attainable.
This process included an analysis of the quarterly
programme performance of the first two quarters of 2013/14 to measure actual
progress against targets and to assess the feasibility of the proposed 2014/15
Managerial committee and Ministerial approval of the MTEC document.
Third draft
The focus was to consolidate, strengthen and improve the overall quality of the final
APP by:
Assessing and where possible, integrating the new set of Sector Indicators that
was received from national Office on the 19th of December 2013 to the APP;
Updating and refining the situational analysis;
Conducting individual discussions with every sub-programme to discuss the new
Sector Indicators and to refine targets based on the actual performance to
date; and
Refining the third draft the APP in line with the conformance report received
from Provincial Treasury.

Situational Analysis
According to Census 2011, the Western Cape has 520,785 persons aged 60 years
and older.
Most of the elderly (60.9%) reside in the Cape Town Metro, followed by
Eden (12.7%) and the Cape Winelands (12.1%).
The Central Karoo (1.3%) has the
lowest percentage of older persons in the province, with the Overberg and West
Coast having 6.1% and 6.9% respectively.
In terms of gender, there are more women
than men.
The majority of older men (44,81% )are in the 65-69 years age-group, while
the majority of women are 85 years and older.
44,4% of older persons have an
income between R801- R1 600, but of concern is that 15% of older persons reported
not having an income.
(Census 2011)
The number of persons aged 60 years and older has grown by 48% between the
2001 and 2011 Censuses whereas the total population only grew by 29% in the same
period.
This has major implications for service delivery for older persons.
For instance,
the fastest growing population of older persons is in geographical areas that
historical did not have a large proportion of older persons.
There is therefore a
mismatch between where the traditional services for older person are and where the
growing need is.
In the same period, the number of older persons aged 85 years and
older grew by 73%.
This in particular has implications for the provision and support of
frail care services for older persons.
Persons with disabilities are recorded in six categories in Census 2011: sight; hearing;
remembering; mobility; communication; and self-care.
The sixth category deals with
ability of an individual to care for her/him-self.
According to Census 2011, 1,041,55311
persons, reported to be living people with various forms of disability, in the Western
Cape excluding self-care.
11 This number is less than the sum total of all the types of disability mentioned because some people have multiple
disabilities and are included in more than one category 30
Sub-Programme 2.1.
Management and Support
Objective of Sub-programme
Provide for the payment of salaries and administration cost of the management and
support staff providing services across all sub-programmes of this programme.
Sub-Programme 2.2 Care and Services to Older Persons
Objective of Sub-programme
Design and implement integrated services for the care, support and protection of
older persons.
Programme Focus
The Older Persons Programme has a developmental approach to ageing which also
seeks to keep older persons in their families and communities for as long as possible.
The main objective would be to care, support and protect older persons with a
strong focus on the poor and vulnerable within communities.
The Older Persons Act
No. 13 of 2006 will continue to direct this programme, and the following strategic
shifts will progressively be implemented:
From social welfare to social development: this will contribute significantly to
increasing participation and independence by older persons.
From rights to rights and responsibilities: the emphasis on information and
communication about legislation, policies and government services to older
persons and service providers.
From reactive to proactive; identifying vulnerable individuals and issues and
intervening before a crisis occur.
This would mean that an enabling environment has to be created (e.g. access
to Service Centres for Older Persons, Home-based care services, etc.) to allow
an older person to live in the community for as long as possible.
Accessing care
and services at a residential facility is considered when the level of frailty of an
older person cannot be suitably addressed by any other means.
31
In prioritising needs within the available resources, the programme will focus on the
following interventions:
There remains a need for residential care facilities for frail older persons, despite
the relatively high costs.
In order to provide for remaining needs in communities
where these services do not exist, alternative care and support models will
continue to be supported and gradually expanded on in certain geographical
areas of greatest need.
This refer to Day Care centres, Service Centres, Senior
concept of keeping older persons within the communities for as long as possible.
A range of services which include exercise programmes, nutrition and protection
of older persons are being addressed by implementing these models.
The Older Persons Act prescribes three different types of residential facilities,
namely independent living, assisted living and frail care in order to afford older
persons the opportunity to access these facilities according to their physical and
health needs.
Thus older persons can be residents of independent and assisted
living facilities whilst continue to reside in communities and being supported with
the necessary services made available through community based care initiatives.
The programme will continue to create an enabling environment in order to
maintain and enhance the capacity, self-participation, well-being and protection
of older persons whilst at the same time ensuring quality service rendered by
service providers.
Although not in a position to substantially expand on any new
services to adequately address the Western Cape population dynamics for older
persons, it will strive to balance various needs by enhancing and maintaining the
quality of existing services that will comply with the Older Persons Act as well as
service delivery norms and standards.
To achieve the above, the programme revisited the funding levels to ensure care
and support for older persons in Residential Facilities and Community Based Care
Support Centres as part of its strategy to maintain and support existing social
welfare services for older persons in the province.
Mindful of the various socio-economic variables which negatively impact on the
quality of life and wellbeing of older persons, the programme will maintain
services rendered by a range of NPO partners employing social service
professionals who render specialised services.

37 Programme Focus
The Social Relief Sub-Programme provides temporary financial and material assistance to persons who are in dire need and unable to meet the basic needs of
their families and themselves.
Social Relief of Distress (SRD) is the temporary provision
of assistance by government, to such individuals and their families.
The Social Assistance Act, (Act No 13 of 2004) contains the criteria with which these individuals
must comply in order to be considered for the grant.
The social relief programme
also makes provision for those who have been affected by a disaster as defined in the Disaster Management Act (Act No. 57 of 2002).
Currently the South African
Social Security Agency (SASSA) is the budget holder of these two grant categories.
Social Relief of Distress is a temporary provision of assistance by government, to such
individuals and their families.

Situational analysis
Census 2011 reports that there are 1,634,000 households in the Western Cape with an
average household size of 3,56 members.
Many of these families and households are
experiencing significant socio-economic challenges in providing for the needs of its
members.
Risk factors such as poverty, unemployment, crime, gangsterism and
substance abuse, threaten the well-being of many families in the province.
According to Census 2011, 60,6% of the heads of these households were employed
in 2011.
Of concern is that 13,3% of households reported not having any income.
The
median age of heads of household is 43 years.
54,2% reported that they are married
while 20,9% indicated that they have never been married.
Many families face a significant burden of care, for example, in Census 2011 it was
found that 10,4% of household members are grandchildren. Census 2011 reports that
there are 1,739,425 children between the ages of 0 and 17 years in the Western
63% of children reside in the City of Cape Town followed by 14% in the Cape
Winelands; 10% in Eden, 7% in the West Coast, 4% in the Overberg and 1% in the
Central Karoo.
In terms of gender, there are 877,084 male and 862,342 female
children between the ages of 0 to 17 years.
The province has a high incidence of child maltreatment that should be addressed
through ongoing child protection strategies.
In addition, the social and economic
vulnerability of children should also be addressed.
For example, in 2011, 19,645
In addition, Census
2011 found that there are 3,482 child headed households in the province.
42
The number of children living in income poverty (households with a monthly per
capita income less than R604) in the province stood at 31,8% (578,000 children) in
201129.
This should also be addressed in order to prevent neglect and promote the
optimal development and well-being of these children.
In addition, the General
Household Survey of 2011 found that 14,7% of children in the province were living in
households without an employed adult.

Objective of Sub-programme
Provide for the payment of salaries and administration cost of the management and

Sub-Programme 3.2 Care and Support Services to Families
Objective of Sub-programme
Programmes and services to promote functional families and to prevent vulnerability
in families.
This programme focuses on building resilience for families, through the provision of a
range of family preservation and strengthening services.
As the anchor programme
within DSD and a critical PSO8 deliverable, all programmatic interventions are
contextualised within the family oriented focus.
Thus the services or indicators for
family preservation services (including family counseling) are closely linked to the
social pathologies, i.e. substance abuse, violence and families facing crisis situations.
These indicators are linked to parenting support programmes for at-risk families, most
notably single parent families.
A core focus is on young parents and the associated
risk for children born to mothers under 18 years.

10 Programme 4: Restorative Services
Provide integrated developmental social crime prevention and anti-substance
abuse services to the most vulnerable in partnership with stakeholders and civil
society organisations.
Situational Analysis
The incidence of crime, in particular contact crime in the Western Cape remains of
concern due to its harmful effects on the provinces social and economic well-
being. Key indicators of crime trends in the province as reflected in the 2011/12
statistical release of the South African Police Services (SAPS), raise concern regarding
the following categories of contact crime:
In 2011/12, the Western Cape had the second highest murder rate of all
provinces; as well as the second highest rate of attempted murder and common assault; and
The province had the highest rate of sexual assault of all provinces at a rate of
173,1 persons per 100,000 of the population.
Over the same period, 7,430 cases
of sexual assault were reported to health facilities in the province (Western Cape
Department of Health, 2012).
The 9,3% increase in robbery at residential premises between the period 2010/11 and
2011/12, in addition to the province having the highest rate of common robbery,
contribute to the sense of fear and lack of safety experienced by residents of the
province.
The most significant increase in reported crime in the province occurred in the
category drug related crime, with an increase of 44,8% in the period 2008/9 to 2011/12.
In the development of crime prevention strategies, consideration has to be
given to the association between substance abuse in the province and other forms
of violent crime.
Substance abuse, mainly alcohol abuse, has consistently been
identified as a significant contributor to violent crime, in the Province (Community
Safety Barometer, 2010). 58
Crime occurring at a highly interpersonal and household level, namely domestic
violence, increased by 18% in the period 2007 to 2010.
In 2010, 21,383 cases were
reported (Western Cape Department of Social Development, 2013).
It should furthermore be noted that crime continues to be underreported, partly due
to a breakdown of social trust between communities and law enforcement
agencies such as the SAPS and the criminal justice system.
Although not easily
quantifiable, this lack of social trust and the frustration of communities with the
entrenched nature of violent crime in their communities are evident for example in
increasing vigilantism (demonstrated by incidents of necklacing in township areas
around the Cape Metro) and gang related activity in the province.
Male youth in
the province appear to be at particular risk of involvement in violent crime and anti-
social formations such as gangs.
In view of the high levels of violent crime in the Western Cape, the VEP programme
should broaden its scope to include victimisation taking place at the community,
household and individual level, as well as primary and secondary forms of
victimisation.
For example, consideration must be given to the various forms of
victimisation experienced by communities who are constantly exposed to high levels
of violent crime, for example, areas where gangsterism are rife or where a marked
breakdown of social trust between residents and law enforcement agencies have
occurred.
The 2012 Victims of Crime Survey provides valuable insight into the perceptions and
experiences of residents of the province who are subject to violent crime in their
households and communities, resulting in a sense of fear and lack of security.
The
Victims of Crime Survey also found for example that compared to other provinces,
the Western Cape had the highest proportion of households, namely 44,1%, who
perceived that violent crimes has increased (Victims of Crime Survey, 2012).
In
addition, 46,6% of households believed that property crime had increased while 82%
of households believed that drug related needs was the motivation for property
crime.
In terms of the gendered nature of crime, only 26,2% of female headed households
felt safe walking alone when it is dark, while only 30,3% of females reported feeling
safe when walking alone during the day.
59
The VEP Programme should focus in particular on victims of sexual assault and
secondary victims of murder in view of the province having the highest rate of sexual
assault of all provinces in 2011/12, and the second highest murder rate of all
provinces; as well as the second highest rate of attempted murder and common
assault.
The programme should also focus on crime occurring at a highly interpersonal and
household level, namely domestic violence, that increased by 18% in the period
2007 to 2010.
In 2010, 21,383 cases were reported (Western Cape DSD, 2013).
In terms of awareness of VEP services, 53,6% of households knew where to take a
crime victim to access services.
An analysis of data from the SAPS regarding drug related crime in the Western Cape,
raises concern regarding the extent of substance abuse in the province.
Drug
related crime in the province increased by 287% for the period April 2003 and March
2012.
Furthermore, in 2011, drug related crime in the Western Cape accounted for
44% of the national total.
Over the same period, the number of reported cases of
driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs increased substantially, namely by
254%.
An analysis of treatment data from the South African Community Epidemiology
Network on Drug Use (SACENDU) for the period 2007 to 2012 indicated that by the
end of 2012, for the largest proportion of service users (34%) methamphetamine was
their primary substance of abuse, followed by alcohol (24%), cannabis (20%) and
heroin (16%).
Regarding patients younger than 20 years, in the second half of 2012, for the largest
proportion of patients, cannabis was their primary substance of abuse (70%),
followed by methamphetamine (18%).
Furthermore, there has been a steady
increase in the proportion of patients admitted for cannabis abuse since the
beginning of 2007.
Conversely, the proportion of patients receiving treatment for
methamphetamine has steadily declined since 2006, from 50% to 18% in 2012.
Treatment demand for heroin abuse has also declined over the same period. 60
Sub-Programme 4.1 Management and Support
Provide for the payment of salaries and administration cost of the management and
support staff providing services across all sub-programmes of this programme.
2 Social Crime Prevention and Support
Objective of Sub-programme
Develop and
implement social crime prevention programmes and provide
probation services targeting children, youth and adult offenders and victims in the
criminal justice process.
Programme Focus
The programme will ensure the provision of integrated and evidence-based crime
prevention and support services that reduce risk factors and enhance protective
factors for children and youth in high risk communities to develop to their fullest
potential and become responsible, resilient and productive members of society.
The programme aims to reduce recidivism by providing a continuum of specialised
probation services to persons (children and adults) in conflict with the law and their
victims, to equip beneficiaries with the skills to enhance their resilience to social
crime risk factors.
Another key focus will be to expand and intensify its social crime prevention
programmes, notably programmes that are aimed at creating and sustaining a
positive social environment and that address the link between substance abuse,
crime and violence and in high-risk areas.
The department will assess the impact of service delivery by monitoring the number
of children who re-offend within a year after completion of a community-based
and/ or residential programme.
The department will focus on the reduction of recidivism by comparing and
monitoring all reported numbers relating to diversions to gauge the impact of
service.
61
Reduce recidivism through an effective probation service to all vulnerable
children and adults by March 2015.
Reduce the extent of recidivism and vulnerability to crime by providing
psycho-social and statutory services to children, youth and adult offenders
and victims within the criminal justice process by March 2015 for 17 830 beneficiaries
Number of Children and Adults benefiting from social crime support services per year: 17 580
This objective is in line with the Child Justice Act No 75 of 2008, Childrens Act,
38 of 2005, the Probation Services Act, the Draft National Social Crime

3 Victim Empowerment
Design and implement integrated programmes and services to support, care and
empower victims of violence and crime in particular women and children.
Programme focus
62 The 2012/13 Annual Report reflects that not all the performance information could be validated.
The 2013/14target
is based on the reported but not validated achievement.
63 This performance is based on the actual validated information for 2013/14
64 This performance is based on the actual validated information for 2013/14
63 All victims of violence and crime including their families have a right to access
services.
Historically this programme focused on victims of domestic violence, sexual
assault and rape.
The need for services is bigger and broader than these afore-
mentioned categories.
For this reason the programme plans to progressively
integrate services supporting all victims, over the MTEF period.
The programme aims to sustain existing shelters and enhance quality of services to
victims of crime; hence focus will be to capacitate shelters to comply with the
applicable minimum norms and standards.
Training interventions with and capacitation with DSD staff and staff at funded NPOs
will continue with the objective of enhancing quality services.
Gender based violence remain pervasive in high-risk communities and the number
of young perpetrators are increasing.
To combat this phenomena youth, including
youth with disabilities in communities will be actively targeted and exposed to
gender based violence prevention programmes.
Contribute to and participate in service delivery to victims of human trafficking in
compliance with the Prevention and Combatting of Trafficking in Persons Act (Act 7
through rehabilitative and prevention services.
Facilitate skills development in shelters in collaboration with the Department of
Economic Affairs and Tourism as well as our Community Development Chief
Directorate and relevant service providers.
Expand, enhance and establish victim support services to victims of crime and
violence in rural areas as well as urban high risk communities of the Western Cape
Province.
Victim support services at the DSD local offices include the following:
Victim impact assessments
intervention,
therapeutic
interventions, assessment,
referrals and
prevention.
64 Strategic Objective
access to a continuum of services
Objective Statement Contribute to the empowerment of 17 266 victims of domestic violence and
reduce risk of sexual and physical violence by ensuring access to a continuum
of services, reaching 17 266 victims for the year concluding by March 2015.
Number of victims accessing support services and programmes that promote
victim empowerment : 16 400
Victim Empowerment is one of the key pillars of the National Crime Prevention
Strategy that was developed in 1996. The Victim Empowerment National Plan
of Action was endorsed in 1998.
Services that counteract victimisation are
currently offered by a variety of role players, both governmental and non-
governmental.
Currently services are inequitable especially in poor communities and rural
areas.
The disintegrated and uncoordinated approach to service delivery
contributes to secondary victimisation.
DSD is the lead department and is
responsible for the coordination of the successful implementation of the Victim
Empowerment Programme across various departments
developmental social welfare services by empowering victims and offering
them opportunities to develop, and by promoting awareness of woman and
child abuse, It also links to PSO 5: Increasing safety, PSO 8: Promotion of
Social Inclusion and Reduction of Poverty, National Outcome 3: All people in
South Africa are and feel safe and National Outcome 11: Creating a better
South Africa and contributing to a better and safer Africa in a better world.
The objective is also linked to the National Crime Prevention Strategy and the
vision of the department to create a self-reliant society

10.2.2 Performance and Expenditure Trends
The DSDs plans and budgets will continue to be redirected for the most economic,
effective and efficient fit between community needs and national and provincial
strategic priorities, of which the most significant is Provincial Strategic Objective 8:
Promoting social inclusion and reducing poverty.
During this MTEF period, the following strategic decisions will influence the realisation
of the strategic outcomes:
Provision for inflationary increases in funding to the NPO sector.
Focus on deepening community based responses such as early intervention and
outpatient treatment wrt substance abuse.
Expansion into rural areas in VEP programme.
Continue with the optimised management of the departments facilities and
provision of services.

11 Programme 5: Development and Research
Provide sustainable development programmes, which facilitate empowerment of
communities, based on empirical research and demographic information.
Situational Analysis
The Western Cape is home to 2,2 million youth between the age of 15 and 34 years
old.
Only 58% of the Provinces youth were born in the Western Cape.
20,4% were
born in the Eastern Cape, 6,8% in the rest of SA and 5,4% outside of SA.
Two thirds of
the youth live in the City of Cape Town and one third in the rest of the province.
Drakenstein, Stellenbosch, Breede Valley and George Municipalities have the largest
concentration of youth outside of the City.
Young people dropping out of school is a huge problem.
The problem starts at
approximately age 12 and by age 16 almost 14% of children have dropped out of
school.
The problem is most evident along the West Coast where more than 22%
have dropped out of school by the age of 16 years.
Ten percent of the provinces
youth over the age of 14 have less than 7 years formal education and can be
considered to be functionally illiterate.
Various forms of youth risk behaviour in the province continue to raise concern.
A recent survey of grade 8 to 10 learners77 in Western Cape provincial schools
highlighted disturbing trends regarding substance abuse and sexual risk behaviour
among the youth who participated in the survey.
In terms of substance abuse, 66%
used cannabis.
Regarding sexual risk behaviour, 31,6% of learners reported having
had sex in their lifetime.
Of concern is that almost 60% of sexually active learners
reported having had unprotected sex on at least one occasion.
The high percentage of learners who have been exposed to community crime
should be addressed through the provision of appropriate psycho-social support

services.
In the 12 months prior to the survey, over 40% of the learners had seen a
stabbing and almost a quarter had witnessed someone being shot.
Various research studies have indicated that youth in the Western Cape are at risk of
involvement in violent subcultures such as gangsterism.
Regarding youth in conflict
with the law, the Annual Report on the Implementation of the Child Justice Act
78 found that the Western Cape has the second highest number of children
awaiting trial at 624 cases (after Gauteng at 642) and has the highest number for
trials conducted in child justice courts at 1393 (followed by Kwazulu-Natal at 597).
Concern exists about the vulnerability of youth in the province.
Using data from
Census 2011,
it has been calculated that 13% of youth
in the province
(approximately 277,160) can be classified as NEETS79.
Of further concern is that 23%
of youth older than 20 years are unemployed.
More than 60% of the unemployed
have completed less than Matric.
Of those that have employment, nearly 60% earn
monthly incomes of less than R3,200 per month.

74 Sub-Programme 5.3 Institutional Capacity Building and Support
for NPOs (ICB)
To support NPO registration and compliance monitoring, NPO stakeholder liaison and
communication, provide institutional capacity building, manage NPO funding and
monitoring and create a conducive environment for all NPO to flourish.
Programme focus
The strategic vision of the ICB programme is to grow a dynamic, sustainable, healthy and
effective NPO sector.
The well-being of the NPO sector is not the concern of DSD alone.
In collaboration with key partners DSD led the development of a Provincial ICB strategy
to guide all role players towards a common vision.
In support of the Provincial ICB
strategy, key interventions of the programme will be delivered through the provision of
information, training, capacity building, a NPO Help Desk function and local networks of
support to NPOs on a regional level.
It is recognised that the NPO sector is a significant
partner to DSD in enhancing access to social services throughout the province.
Within
the Western Cape Province a total number of 3 796 NPOs (30 September 2011) are
registered within the Social Development sector.
The significance of this partnership with
NPOs is illustrated through an allocation of 54% of the Departments transfer payment
budget (2011/12) to approximately 1 870 NPOs (2011/12).
In acknowledging the significance of this partnership, it is recognised that the NPO
sector is a vibrant and ever changing sector that operates in a complex and ever
changing environment.
Key challenges and developmental areas experienced by
NPOs have been found to be in the areas of governance, financial management,
monitoring and evaluation, planning and managing operations and fundraising
towards sustainability.
These challenges hamper the department in its efforts at delivering a predictable
and sustained network of contracted social welfare services.
It also reduces service
delivery partners overall ability to accurately account for public funds disbursed. To
respond to the above-mentioned challenges the programme will specifically focus on:
Registration Support Services (help desk)
75  NPO Governance and Functionality (Training)
Coaching Support (Mentoring).
All the above interventions will be systematically strengthened by aftercare support
services and facilitated by Community Development Practitioners in the various
regions.

Objective of Sub-programme Create an environment to help young people to develop constructive, affirmative and
sustainable relationships while concurrently providing opportunities for them to build their
that of their communities.
The primary focus of this programme is on the holistic skills development of young
people to make them more employable, positive, healthy and prepared for
adulthood.
This entails life skills, character development skills, mentoring and
coaching, leadership training, entrepreneurship and skills development.
This is done by focusing on the provision of accessible services, opportunities and support for all
young people, but a specific focus on the NEETs (Not in Employment, Education,
and/or Training).
The EPWP (Expanded Public Works Programme) unit will with the
increase in budget also involve NEETs into the employment sphere.
Opportunities will
be negotiated through different service providers in the social sector.
Interventions include amongst others:
Non formal skills training inclusive of arts, sport, dance and music.
Formal training which include accredited training and job preparedness.
Semi- formal which include holistic services to the youth.
Mentoring and support.
Provision of Youth Cafes to create more opportunities.
Increasing work opportunities through MOD centre assistants, Youth Cafs and a
wide array of opportunities for social services.

Access to appropriate social development services for youth in school and
youth out of school
Objective Statement
Facilitate opportunities for youth to access a range of social development
services that promote positive life styles and responsible citizenship for young people by March 2015
Baseline Number of youth in skills development programmes through partnering
with other government departments: 14 202 Justification
The National Youth Development Strategy is aligned with this provincial
initiative and part of the early intervention level of service delivery. The
objective will contribute towards well-adjusted youth who can fend for
themselves and contribute positively to family and community life Links
This objective links to DSD Strategic Goals 2: Create opportunities through
community development services and 3: Create a caring society through developmental social welfare services.
It also links to PSO 8: Promotion of Social Inclusion and Reduction of
Poverty, National Outcomes 5: A skilled and capable workforce to

How to replace a tap washer
What you need:
1. Adjustable wrench/spanner
2. Screwdriver (medium size)
Step 1: Turn off the isolation valve to your taps so that water dont spill all over your
bathroom.
Step 2:
2
Do It Yourself Home Maintenance Guide
Step 3:
Unclip the lid of the tap (often the bit that says H for hot or C for cold).
Step 4:
Theres a screw inside.
Unscrew it (righty tighty, lefty loosey) and remove the
hand grip portion and unscrew the cover.
Step 5:
Remove the cartridge.
This can be quite tricky.
Use an adjustable spanner and
some force.
Pull the cartridge out.
3
Do It Yourself Home Maintenance Guide
Step 6:
Unscrew it and remove.
Step 7:
Get in the car or on the bus to your nearest plumbers merchant.
Show them
the cartridge and ask for a new washer to fit.
There are MANY different kinds
of washer and all your taps will have different ones.
This will save you time,
effort and money in the long run.
Step 8:
Unscrew or pop off the washer, pop the new one in and put your tap back
together.
Step 9:
Tighten it all up hand-tight, plus a quarter turn.
Top tip:
As you dissemble your tap, its clever to keep all the separate parts in the
order in which they came out so that you can easily put them back again.
4
5
Do It Yourself Home Maintenance Guide Step 4:
Now take your flat head screw driver and unscrew the screws that are in each pin.
Be careful not to unscrew the screws completely, just unscrew them
enough so that you are now able to see clearly through the hole in each pin. Step 5:
Look for the 2 plastic sleeves at the bottom center of the plug. Remove the sleeves.
This will make it easier for you when you need to start connecting
your wiring to the pins. Step 6:
Use the wire strippers to strip away 1cm of the plastic of the 3 wires to expose
the copper cabling within.
Or if you dont have wire stripper just cut the plastic.
6
Do It Yourself Home Maintenance Guide
Step 7:
Now before you even consider connecting the wiring pins, there are a couple
of things to always remember.
When looking at your plug you will see that
for the 2 short pins there are markings on the plug which tell you which wires
must be connected to which pin.
If you connect your wiring to the wrong pins
and you put your plug into the wall socket then things can go horribly wrong.
If youre lucky it could just trip your mains but more seriously it could give you
an electrical shock or even cause a fire which is not a good thing at all.
If you
have a look at the 3 wires you are going to connect, the general rule is that
they are 3 different colors: blue, brown and green with a yellow stripe in it or
sometimes just plain green.
These 3 colored wires are very important to your
connecting of the plug.
On the plug the 3 markings you will see is as follows:
where the central long pin is situated, there is an E imprinted, at the bottom
side of the small pin there is a N imprinted and the right small pin there is a
L imprinted. These 3 letter stand for: EARTH, NEUTRAL and LIVE.
Step 8:
The green and yellow striped wire is connected to the long pin in the Central
top of the plug. This will earth the plug and prevent any electrical shocks.
Take your yellow wire and insert it into the hole of the pin marked with an E
then fasten the screw which will tighten against the wire and keep it in the pin.
7
Do It Yourself Home Maintenance Guide
The blue wire is connected to the left pin which is your neutral, which helps
the electric current run through the appliance back to the source of power
where it came from otherwise your electrical current will only end at the plug
and not reach through to the appliance that is connected to the plug.
Take
your Blue wire and insert it into the hole of the pin marked with an N then
fasten as per above.
Step 10:
The brown wire is connected to the right pin which is your live; this is the wire
which actually carries the electricity through to your appliance that your plug
is connected to.
Take your Brown wire and insert it into the hole of the pin
marked with an L then fasten as per above.
Step 11:
After doing this, you can now put the 2 plastic sleeves back into position.
will now keep the wires securely in place and prevent them from being pulled
out of the pins by accident.

How to replace a light bulb
Step 1:
Look at the lamp that is currently not working.
If there is not a bulb install a
bulb of the correct wattage for that lamp or fixture.
Step 2:
Make sure you turn the switch off.
This will prevent you from being
electrocuted.
If the bulb you are replacing is still working, let it cool down for about 30
seconds or more.
If there is no bulb it is ok to skip this step.

1.5 FOREWORD BY THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE WESTERN CAPE LANGUAGE COMMITTEE
Chairperson and Members
The Constitution of the Western Cape which was passed in 1998 provides for equal status for
English, Afrikaans and isiXhosa and requires practical and positive measures to be taken to
elevate the status, and advance the use, of indigenous languages in the province.
The Western
Cape Language Committee (WCLC) is a statutory body tasked with ensuring equal status for the
three official languages.
It also has a mandate to advise the provincial Minister as well as the
Pan South African Language Board on language matters in the Western Cape.
Over the past 12 years I have been involved in the work of the Committee, six of these as
chairperson.
I am happy to report that much progress has been made towards advancing
multilingualism in that time. A recent highlight was The State of Multilingualism in the Western
Capea day-long conference on 20 February 2012 organised by the Language Committee to
celebrate International Mother Language Day.
The event was addressed by dignitaries,
academics and participants from the language fraternity.
Language is much more than just a medium of communication  it is a vehicle for nation
building and for people to engage with one another and to express their identities, cultural
values and world views.
This is so important that the rights of 11 languages are entrenched in our
national Constitution.
However, little has been done since the advent of democracy in South
Africa to ensure that indigenous languages take up their rightful place.
An important recent
development is that Parliament is in the process of finalising the South African Languages Bill in
order to comply with a court order to pass a national language law.
The Committee advised the
Minister on the importance of language rights in a presentation on the draft SA Languages Bill.
Although all provincial departments are required to adhere to the policy, few are indeed living
up to what is expected of them.
In his Budget speech, the Minister spoke with approval about
the efforts of the Noluthando School for the Deaf in Khayelitsha to teach South African Sign
dictionary of agricultural terms.
This is all evidence of the Western Capes progress towards the
goal of achieving social inclusion through supporting the use of all three official languages.
The Language Committee has changed its modus operandi.
Initially, the Committee funded
publications, SA Sign Language learning and teaching, isiXhosa mother tongue reading and
writing, and language festivals.
relationship with the Language Committee.
It is the view of the Committee, as well as my personal belief, that all languages are assets that
need to be advanced and protected.
Finally, chairperson and members, this year brings to a
close my 12-year
I was present when Neville
Alexander, Stan Ridge and the late Johan Combrinck conceptualised a Language Policy for the
Western Cape, giving meaning to the term three official languages.
The Western Cape has led
the way by enacting a language law and a language policy.
I am more than hopeful that our
pioneering work in these areas will be reproduced on a national level.
I have had a long and exciting journey over the last 12 years with the provincial government
and the Language Committee.
However, this is certainly not a farewell; I will be back, albeit in a
different capacity.
Ek sluit af met die gevleuelde woorde van een van die grootste Afrikaanse geeste van ons tyd,
Adam Small.
Voorsitter, ek is trots om te s dat ek deel was van die besluit, te laat maar darem,
om Adam Small onlangs met die Hertzogprys te bekroon.
Dit is iets wat hy natuurlik lankal (1965)
moes gekry het, maar wat weens apartheid hom ontneem is.
Sy woorde is in die vorm van n
gebed:
Sen hierdie taal Here,
Afrikaans, en Kaaps
Wat, soes ek vi djou ges het,
Gemaak is vi die kitaar
Soes n sexy engel

Target Actual
For the reporting year, the Committee undertook to continue monitoring the implementation of
the Language Policy by conducting further research of interpreting services provided at the
Provincial Parliament.
The aim of the project was to establish, by means of a questionnaire
administered to the legislators themselves, how they experience the interpreting services
provided in the legislature.
A total of 42 questionnaires were sent out in March 2011 of which 16
were completed and returned.
The findings put forth in the report compiled after clearly
analysing the responses received, led to clear recommendations.
The Speaker was informed of the outcome of the questionnaire indicating that more research
should be conducted, at the expense of the Language Committee.
With the approval of the
Speaker, further research was then conducted to investigate the way forward in respect of the
recommendations made in the previous
The research resulted in further
recommendations being made as to how the service can be brought to a level acceptable to
an institution such as the Provincial Parliament.
One of the recommendations is that an
awareness campaign should be launched on the value of a good interpreting service as a vital
communication tool in a multilingual environment. report.
It was recommended that users be trained on the technical aspects of the interpreting
equipment to ensure that it is used optimally.
It was further recommended that the approach
used by the City of Cape Town be adopted in terms of which the interpreting service is
evaluated after every meeting, which allows for problems to be identified and ironed out almost
immediately.
International Mother Language Day was celebrated by the Language Committee through the
hosting of a conference entitled The State of Multilingualism in the Western Cape.
Prominent
speakers included Minister Ivan Meyer and a variety of language specialists. It was noted that
language is not simply a means of communication, it is inextricably linked to identity and should
allow people to realise their dreams.
People in South Africa should learn each others languages
in order to understand one another better.
Minister Meyer suggested it was time to move
beyond debates and become actively involved in the struggle for multilingualism in the Western Cape.
He said that prominent people should become ambassadors for their mother tongues.
Dr Neville Alexander spoke of the need for mother tongue-based education and said it is
important to view languages as assets.
Prof. Rajendra Chetty spoke about how gaining a good
command of English is necessary for learners to empower themselves; at the same time, it is
necessary to challenge the hegemonic power of English.
He further stated that there is a clear
need to improve the quality of teaching in English.
Prof. Stanley Ridge stressed the need for
engagement between English and other languages.
If language cannot empower a person to
put bread on the table, it is of no use.

REPORT OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL TO THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCIAL PARLIAMENT
ON THE WESTERN CAPE LANGUAGE COMMITTEE
REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Introduction
I have audited the financial statements of the Western Cape Language Committee set out
on pages 29 to 45, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 March 2012,
the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets and the cash
flow statement for the year then ended, and the notes, comprising a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Accounting authoritys responsibility for the financial statements
The accounting authority is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
financial statements in accordance with South African Standards of Generally Recognised
Accounting Practice (SA Standards of GRAP), the requirements of the Public Finance
Management Act of South Africa, 1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999) (PFMA) and section 19(5) of the
Western Cape Provincial Languages Act, 1998 (Act No. 13 of 1998) (WCPLA) and for such
internal control as the accounting authority determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.
Auditor-Generals responsibility
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I
conducted my audit in accordance with the Public Audit Act of South Africa, 2004 (Act No.
(PAA), the General Notice issued in terms thereof and International Standards on
Auditing.
Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free from material misstatement.
4.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entitys
internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
5.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for my audit opinion.
Opinion
6.
In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Western Cape Language Committee as at 31 March 2012, and its financial
performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with SA Standards of
GRAP and the requirements of the PFMA and the WCPLA. 26

WESTERN CAPE LANGUAGE COMMITTEE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 March 2012
Accounting policies for material transactions, events or conditions not covered by the GRAP
Standards adopted, have been developed in accordance with paragraphs 7, 11 and 12 of
GRAP 3.
These accounting policies and the applicable disclosures have been based on
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and the South African Statements of
Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP),
including any interpretations of such
Statements issued by the Accounting Practices Board.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GRAP requires management to make
judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year or in
the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.

been met for the entitys activities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.

expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
1.8.1 Provision for impairment of receivables
An estimate for the impairment of receivables is made when collection of the full amount is no
longer probable.
The provision for impairment debt shall be calculated on trade receivables
only.
The total impairment provision of the entity shall be calculated either by individual debtor
or at least per risk category.
1.9.
VAT & POSSIBLE EXEMPTIONS
The entity is not entitled to register as a VAT vendor.

The entitys activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (fair value interest rate risk,
, credit risk and liquidity risk.

of receiving an invoice as required by the treasury regulations and the PFMA.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due.
In terms of its borrowing requirements, the entity ensures that adequate funds are available
to meet
its expected and unexpected financial commitments.
All outstanding Accounts
payable balances are due within 30 days of the reporting date.
Sensitivity analysis
At 31 March 2012, if the interest rates on variable rate financial
instruments had been 1%
higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post tax profit for the year would have been
R1,310 higher/lower.
Interest rate risk

the entity to fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk and can be summarized as
follows:

#BoozeFreeRoads
This festive season, most of us are looking forward to taking time off work, and many of us will
be travelling with our families and friends to holiday destinations throughout our beautiful country
and beyond.
The festive season is associated with great increases in the numbers of people travelling on our
roads. People are also more inclined to over-indulge in alcohol and other drugs, some in
celebration and, sadly, some to escape the sorrow that can also come at this time of
year, remembering lost loved ones and other tragedies.
It is thus important to remind ourselves of the ever-present dangers on our
roads.
The efforts of Provincial Traffic Services and our partners in law
enforcement, health services and education have seen steady decreases
in the numbers of holiday road deaths.
However, there have been a total
of 640 deaths over last three December-January holiday periods alone.
This death toll masks the burden of hundreds of serious injuries over this
period, and the tragedies endured by the families and friends of the victims.
In these numbers, we can also see the invisible hand dragging government
services away from the many other needs of our society.
Police attending to
crash scenes while criminals strike elsewhere, emergency rooms and intensive
care units choked with the injured while other patients wait, and a court system
clogged with drunken driving cases are just a few examples.
This same hand has
a stranglehold on our economic prospects, as crashes cut short the life prospects of
economically active people and shut down our highways and freeways, driving up transport
costs and the insurance burden many families are struggling with.
The good news is that each and every one of us can make a difference through our own behaviour.
First, the simple fact is that alcohol and roads dont mix.
Even small amounts of alcohol can impair your ability
to make decisions, operate a vehicle, or walk safely near traffic, whether you are driving, walking, or riding a
motorbike or bicycle.
If youre drinking, dont drive.
The best way to do this is to stay at home, stay at friends, or leave your car at home
if you do go out.
Dont even give yourself the option of driving.
Whether its a taxi, a bus, a train, rather make a Plan
B. It is better to crash on a couch than into a traffic light or another car.
Help us create booze-free roads.
If you
have friends or family who still drive under the influence, speak to them before they get into trouble with the law.
If you are on foot, please dont drink, especially not to excess.
Walking drunk on our roads at
night could get you run over or robbed.
When you are out walking on the roads, make sure
you cross where it is safe, and stay on the pavement.
Most importantly, make sure that
drivers can see you.
Reflective clothing can save your life.
The golden rule is to see and be seen.
Remember the basics.
Watch your speed  there is no deadline more final than a
funeral.
Always buckle up.
When we attend crashes, we dont need to unbuckle
the dead.
Please make sure your vehicle has no defects, especially tyres and
lights, and that windows and mirrors are clean.
Leave your cell phone alone.
No call or text message is worth your life, it can wait.
Tailgating and
reckless overtaking are shortcuts to the grave, and you could take
innocent victims with you.
If you are going to be driving long distances, remember there
is no substitute for sleep.
Caffeine can perk you up, but only
temporarily.
Driving when tired can be as dangerous as
driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
These simple steps will ensure you keep yourself and
your families safe this holiday season.
Finally, while you enjoy this period of rest,
relaxation and reflection, spare a thought
for those emergency personnel, from traffic,
police, medical emergency staff and all the
others working over the holidays to keep us safe.
We all owe them a great vote of thanks
for all they do throughout the year.
Wishing you a wonderful festive season and
a very happy and productive 2016, better
together.

1 DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND SPORT - ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN 2014/2015
FOREWORD
This Annual Performance Plan aims to take us closer to our vision of a socially inclusive, creative, active Western
Cape.
It is intended to create opportunities for our people, especially our youth, to participate in sport, recrea-
tion, arts and culture and improve access to our libraries, museums and heritage and language services.
The increase in our budget is a reflection of the high level of confidence in the management of this Department
to deliver excellent quality service to the people of the Western Cape.
The core values of integrity, accountabil-
ity, competence, responsiveness and caring come together like a golden thread through all our programmes.
We believe this will infuse all of our programmes with excellence and effective corporate governance.
Of particular significance is the increase in the budgets allocated to the Library Service and the MOD (Mass
participation; Opportunity and Access; Development and growth) Programme.
The Library Service plays a piv-
otal role in the empowerment of all, old and young alike.
A high-quality library service can foster a sense of
belonging and pride in local communities.
It also creates important opportunities for people in all regions of the
province to reach a greater level of self-actualisation.
The MOD Programme is the fulcrum around which the Departments youth development initiatives revolve.
The Annual Performance Plan is directed at enhancing the quality of the bouquet of services currently offered at
the 181 MOD Centres in the Western Cape.
Steps have been taken to through more effective management
and monitoring to ensure that MOD Centres steadily improve.
By doing this, the Department expects to be
able to attract a greater number of learners to the after-school sport, arts and culture programmes offered at
these centres.
The Annual Performance Plan acknowledges that the Department will only be able to achieve its objectives
through effective partnerships.
The funding of sport federations as well as key cultural organisations is therefore vital.
The premise is always that larger sport and cultural organisations partner with the Department to empower
smaller, less experienced organisations.

The aim of the Government-wide Monitoring and Evaluation (GWM&E) System is to
contribute to improved governance and to enhance the effectiveness of public
sector organisations and institutions.
This document provides the overarching
policy framework for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in South Africa.
It promotes results-based management.
This document aims to enable government officials and the executive authority to
focus on achieving the outcome and output measures contained in the Medium
Term Strategic Framework (MTSF).
It is intended to promote good departmental
and individual performance at all levels.
These guidelines provide for the development of a monitoring and evaluation
framework in all governmental institutions so that institutions can assess progress
against their stated aims and take remedial action where necessary. This
process requires departments to have a comprehensive understanding of all
administrative data systems, administrative datasets and performance indicators.
The indicators must be linked to specific policy imperatives and analysis of the sets
of indicators must take place to determine whether there are any cause-and-
effect relationships.
The EPWP Business Plans for the Social Sector (Sport) and Environmental and
Culture Sector (Cultural Affairs) provide a framework for DCAS to utilise public
sector funding to reduce and alleviate unemployment.
DCAS and all other provincial departments are obliged to implement the provisions
of the Western Cape Language Policy and the Western Cape Provincial Languages
Act, 1998.
In addition, the Department is tasked with providing language services to
the Western Cape Government through its central language unit.
This document guides the allocation of financial assistance to cultural
organisations.

Impact on DCAS
The applicant filed an urgent application in the High Court to
compel the MEC to make a decision or, alternatively, to issue
the Record of Decision in respect of an appeal lodged with the
MEC in terms of section 49 of the National Heritage Resources
Act, 1999, read with regulation 12(7) of PN 336 of 2003.
The
impact of the judgment on DCAS is that it must ensure that
tribunals issue Records of Decision in good time.
Corrective
measures have been implemented.
The Court considered whether the South African Heritage
Resources Agency or Heritage Western Cape have jurisdiction
in respect of sites that have been graded by SAHRA as Grade
1 sites in terms of sections 35 and 36 of the National Heritage
Resources Act, 1999.
The Court found that, in such cases, SAHRA
has jurisdiction.
The implication of this judgment for DCAS is
that the Department must provide legal assistance to Heritage
Western Cape to interpret the legislation, and it must ensure that
HWC acts within its legal mandate.
As part of the five-year Strategic Plan, the policy initiatives described below are planned for the 2014/15
financial year.

5 UPDATED SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS
The Executive Summary of the National Development Plan 2030 (NDP)1 says that arts and culture open powerful
spaces for debate about where a society finds itself and where it is going (page 26).
Promoted effectively, the
creative and cultural industries can contribute substantially to small business development, job creation and urban
development and renewal.
The NDP summary further states that the countrys rich cultural legacy and the creativity
of its people mean that South Africa can offer unique stories, voices and products to the world.
In addition, artistic
endeavour and expression can foster values, facilitate healing and restore national pride.
This speaks directly to
the key role that DCAS has in contributing to social inclusion, nation-building and national social cohesion. The
NDP envisages that civil society should promote development and community cohesion.
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community-based organisations (CBOs) play a vital social and
employment role.
The NDP summary also recommends: the production and distribution of all art forms that facilitate
healing and nation-building; and incentivising dialogue to promote social cohesion and nation-building (page 66).
As recommended in the NDP, the legislation that DCAS administers provides ongoing opportunities for citizens to
participate in governance beyond simply voting in elections (page 27).
Within DCAS, such governance forums
include the Council and committees of Heritage Western Cape, the Western Cape Cultural Commission, the
Western Cape Language Committee, governing bodies of affiliated museums and a number of other structures.
These bodies provide a voice for citizens as well as opportunities for them to shape the institutions closest to them.
A further recommendation (NDP Executive Summary, page 27) is that the state should actively support and incentivise
citizen engagement.
Our people should be encouraged to actively seek opportunities for advancement, learning,
experience and opportunity and working with others in their communities to advance development, resolve problems
and raise the concerns of the voiceless and marginalised.
To further this goal, DCAS continues its engagement in the
arts, culture and heritage sectors with residents of the Western Cape and through appropriate forums.
The review of the White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage by the national Department of Arts and Culture
aims to update the national governments vision for arts, culture and heritage, as well as the cultural and

This vision is informed by, various consultative processes and meetings with role-players and
stakeholders that have taken place since 2010.
This vision goes beyond social cohesion.
It aims to nourish the
soul of our nation and is based on the strong belief that arts, culture and heritage play a pivotal role in the
economic empowerment and skills development of our people.
The DAC review envisages a rationalisation of
the sector and associated institutions for more efficient and cost-effective action.
DCAS activities are strongly aligned to the One Cape 2040 Vision and the Connecting Cape strategy.
This will contribute
to the development of welcoming, inclusive and integrated communities as well as greater social cohesion.
It will also
contribute to the Western Capes development as a global meeting place and a connector with new markets.
Assistance to Category B3 municipalities (municipalities with small towns and farms) continued during the last
financial year.
During 2013, National Treasury announced that it would substantially increase Conditional Grant
funding.
This funding will substantially reduce the unfunded mandate at all Category B municipalities.
The South African Library Information Bill was costed during 2013 by the national Department of Arts and Culture.
In accordance with the Provincial Archives and Records Service of the Western Cape Act, 2005, the Western
Cape Archives Advisory Committee was established to advise the MEC.
DCASs MOD (Mass participation; Opportunity and access; Development and growth) Programme has helped to
catalyse the integration of the work of different Western Cape Government departments. The MOD Programme
presents an innovative, creative and effective approach to investing in the future of our country, namely our
human resources, especially school-going children.
Intended outcomes include: the inculcation of an ethos of
lifelong activity; the realisation of latent potential; the achievement of excellence in and through activities such
as sport, arts and culture; social inclusion; productive and inclusive citizenship; promoting a sense of patriotism;
as well as supporting values-based, holistic education.
The MOD Programme seeks to address the Western Capes strategic objectives by targeting the causes of social
problems, rather than the symptoms.
It supports public health initiatives by helping to keep youth engaged
in healthy activity.
Over time, this is expected to lower the burden of disease and reduce pressure on the
public health system.
The MOD Programme supports improved community safety by keeping youth active and
engaged in constructive activity.
When communities are safer, police have a greater ability to focus on high-
priority crimes.
It supports improved learner attendance, discipline and academic performance.
This makes a
positive contribution to the functioning of the education system and helps to improve educational outcomes.
Improved educational outcomes have a beneficial long-term impact on the entire economy.
In November 2011, the National Sport and Recreation Plan was adopted.
During the last financial year, school
sport and the establishment of sport academies has given effect to key recommendations of the NSRP.
For example, a top schools sport event took place and youth camps were held throughout the regions of the
Western Cape to support nation-building and social inclusion.
The Better Together Games brings together employees from all departments in the spirit of healthy and enthusiastic
competition, thereby supporting a sense of social inclusion within the Western Cape Government.
District sport
academies were launched in Saldanha and Oudtshoorn to support talent identification and sport excellence at a district level.
With DCAS support, a total of 415 sport clubs were supported to become sustainable and
functional and affiliated to mainstream sport.
In November 2011, traditional and indigenous games were included as one of South Africas priority sporting codes.
A more structured approach and special attention has been given to these games as a key avenue for
mass participation in sport and recreation.
SRSA (the national department responsible for sport and recreation)
has provided DCAS with a budget to promote participation in indigenous games, Golden Games (aimed at
and big walks.
All these projects are annual events catering for senior citizens, youth and adults.
This support encourages strong intergovernmental relations between local, provincial and national departments
responsible for sport and recreation.
These projects also mobilise people from different communities to participate
in recreational activities that will keep them healthy and improve their quality of life.
In accordance with the NSRP, DCAS has assisted with the establishment of sport councils in the Central Karoo
and Overberg districts.
Sport councils are now represented in all six geo-political districts of the Western Cape.
This has created tremendous excitement and enthusiasm within local communities.
Terms of reference have been developed to assist these district structures with the necessary support for:
establishing teams;
putting effective management in place;
incorporating good governance from the outset; and
encouraging the relevant district and local municipality to embrace its sport and recreation responsibilities as described in the NSRP.

DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND SPORT - ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN 2014/2015
A Joint Provincial Task Team (JPTT) has been established to oversee school sport in the province.
The JPTT,
consisting of DCAS and WCED officials, will meet at least twice per school term and regularly consult with the
Western Cape Provincial Sport Confederation in their capacities as custodians of sport in the Western Cape.
Ongoing consultations take place with provincial code-specific structures as per the SRSA mandate.
Capacity building support is provided to these structures to enhance their capacity to deliver school sport programmes.
DCAS
also supports supporting learners and school teams to participate at the South African National Schools Championship
(SANSC), an annual event hosted by SRSA in partnership with the national Department of Basic Education.
Further support will also be given to sport focus schools.
This initiative introduced by SRSA proposed that: 1) such
schools would be introduced in every province; and 2) that each of these schools would focus on two sport codes.
5.1 Performance environment
Cultural Affairs
The 225 EPWP work opportunities which were created in 2013/14 assisted DCAS Cultural Affairs and its
museums, and meeting compliance requirements, including auditing of museum collections.
DCAS plans to expand these programmes with the additional funding allocation for 2014/15.
During 2014, the 20th anniversary of the establishment of a democratic dispensation in South Africa will be celebrated
throughout the country.
DCAS will host the provincial event on 27 April 2014 and other DCAS programmes and
projects presented throughout the year will commemorate the achievements of the past two decades.
The ongoing downturn in the economy, the shifting emphasis in funding policies of national funding agencies such as the
National Lotteries Distribution Trust Fund and the National Arts Council, as well as limited funding from the private sector
has reduced available funding to arts and culture organisations.
During 2012/13, the total amount requested from DCAS
by applicants was R104 million compared to R105 million in 2011/12.
Transfer payments to arts and culture organisations
include payments to the Western Cape Cultural Commission, the Cape minstrels, Christmas bands and Malay choirs.

The Western Cape Museum Policy provides for the establishment of regional museums.
Negotiations with
stakeholders and role-players about the establishment of the first regional museum in 2014/15 are at an
advanced stage.
This will create an exciting opportunity for social inclusion and expand the heritage offering in
the Western Cape for inhabitants and visitors alike.
The finalisation of the draft Western Cape Provincial Museum Bill is awaiting the completion of DACs review of
the national White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage.
The DAC review is expected to provide a clear definition
of what constitutes a national museum.
In the meantime, engagements with the Provincial Treasury and the
Office of the Auditor-General regarding governance and financial management issues are continuing to inform
the development of the proposed provincial museum legislation.
The transformation of museum exhibitions and the public programmes presented at affiliated museums has, for
the first time, resulted in more than 400 000 visitors having visited those museums.
This figure increased further in
2013/14 with a total of 354 762 visitors by the end of the third quarter.
Visitor figures have increased steadily as
records since 2009 indicate (see table below).

New museum exhibitions and public programmes promote cultural tourism and celebrate the cultural heritage of
the communities of the Western Cape.
By showcasing this heritage, the museums are providing visitor experiences
aligned with the national Cultural Heritage Tourism Strategy (2011) and the National Rural Tourism Strategy (2012).
16 DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND SPORT - ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN 2014/2015
Four new exhibitions were completed in 2013/14:
1.
2.
3.
History of the Oude Pastorie, Paarl, at Paarl Museum; and
History of the Wheat Industry, Wheat Industry Museum, Moorreesburg.
Two new travelling exhibitions were launched: Natives Land Act 19132013 and 175 Years After the Emancipation
of Slaves.
In July 2013, the MEC appointed the new Western Cape Provincial Geographical Names Committee for a
term of three years.
The purpose of this committee is to process applications for the naming and renaming of
geographical features and the standardisation of geographical names, and to make recommendations to
the South African Geographical Names Council.
During August 2013, the MEC appointed a new Council for
Heritage Western Cape, also for a term of three years.
The 2011 Census indicates there has been a significant shift since 1996 in the proportion of first language speakers
of the three official languages of the Western Cape.
The proportion of isiXhosa first language speakers increased
to 24.7% (up from 18.9% in 1996).
Although Afrikaans is still the dominant first language of the province (49.7% in
, the proportion of first language speakers decreased from 58.5% in 1996.
The proportion of English speakers
remained constant at about 20%.
The Census indicates that while the population of South Africa as a whole
increased by 6% between 2001 and 2011, the population of the Western Cape increased much more quickly
29% over the same period.
It is possible that this language shift could be the result of migration from other
provinces, particularly the Eastern Cape.
Although the de facto language of business in the Western Cape Government departments is English, most
official documents for public consumption are translated into Afrikaans and isiXhosa in accordance with the
Western Cape Provincial Languages Act, 1996 and the Western Cape Language Policy, 2001.
Library and Archive Services
Census 2011 indicates a 29% increase in the population of the Western Cape over ten years (from 4.5 million
people in 2001 to 5.8 million in 2011).
This has had a direct impact on the demand for services in the province.
This information is taken into account during the strategic planning process and the allocation of resources.
The Library Service works in conjunction with municipalities to provide public library services to communities throughout
the Western Cape.
The number of libraries has grown substantially over the past few years.
However, there are still
communities that do not have access to library and information services.
There is a huge demand for new libraries and upgrades of existing facilities.
The table below shows the steady growth in the number of library centres.

The considerable increase in Conditional Grant funding in the 2014 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
period will begin to address the unfunded mandate of municipalities in respect of providing library services.
Municipal replacement funding for B3 municipalities continues.
Together with Conditional Grant funding, this
covers 100% of library service expenditure in B3 municipalities in the Western Cape.

17 DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND SPORT - ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN 2014/2015
Library materials were audited as assets in the 2012/13 financial year.
The Library Service is investigating new technology to improve its accounting processes.
The commitment to improve access to the archival holdings of the Western Cape Government through electronic
means will continue. This will include an on-going commitment to e-filing, and the digitisation of operational and
historical records.
Having acquired a digital scanner, the Western Cape Archives and Records Service will launch
a pilot programme to make available electronic versions of its historical paper-based records.
This is intended to improve service delivery and respond effectively to client requests for digital reproductions of historical records.
The Archives Service will continue to deliver records management services to Western Cape Government bodies
in accordance with the legislative mandate to build a capable and efficient government.
The following oversight
records management functions are performed annually: the inspections of records and systems; the training of
records management staff; the assessment and approval of records classification systems; the issuing of disposal
authorities; and the provision of general professional assistance.
The Western Cape Archives and Records Service will maintain and continue to participate in cooperative
partnerships with institutions that could heighten its impact.
Popular archival records, mainly material relevant to
family history, are being digitised through a partnership with the Genealogical Society of Utah.
Important changes in the archive and records management field have highlighted the need for amendments to
the Provincial Archives and Records Service of the Western Cape Act, 2005 (Act 3 of 2005).
A process to update
the Act in order to address its gaps and limitations has started.
The Archives and Records Service will continue to amend, update and compile institutional practices, policies and
procedures in line with international best practice and to ensure efficient service delivery to its clients.
One of the core obligations of the Service is to preserve records with enduring value.
Broadly speaking, archival
preservation embraces the transfer of records to the Archives, as well as the processing of records and their capture
in systems that facilitate for access to the information contained in the records.
More narrowly, conservation
preservation is a multi-pronged approach that embraces considerations relating to the environment in which
records are used and stored, as well as the physical repair and treatment of damaged historical records.
In order to bring more people in touch with the richness of our history and the promise of the future, public outreach
activities will continue to be rolled out to communities to teach them how to use the archival holdings.
The focus
will be on the youth, in particular learners and students.
Sport and Recreation
In January and February 2013 trilaterals were held to ascertain how funding grants were utilised.
Trilaterals are
monitoring and evaluation sessions between DCAS, sport councils (representing civil society) and the sport
federations (who are the beneficiaries of funding grants).
As a result, Sport and Recreation was able to introduce
new procedures that enabled transfers to take place earlier than in previous years.
This made it possible for every
qualifying federation to begin implementing its programme more quickly.
The MOD Programme remains a cornerstone of the campaign to encourage youth of school-going age to
become active in sport and recreation.
This programme has the specific aim of encouraging youth to engage
in constructive activities by offering them structured opportunities to be active after school.
This reduces the risk
of young people becoming engaged in high-risk activities such as the use of recreational drugs and delinquent
behaviour.
The MOD Programme, which is a skills development programme, also provides learners with talent
identification opportunities and opportunities for participation in sport at a higher level.
In addition, it has also created a number of jobs for coaches and administrators involved in the programme.
General Budget Support (GBS) funding in the amount of R36 million has been allocated to the MOD Programme in
order for it to become a stand-alone project.
Additional funding has been allocated to boost middle management
capacity in the Programme.
The MOD Programme has also been allocated a further R2 million for the gap year
project which will support learners to develop their mathematics, science and technology skills.
Those MOD Programme learners who show potential and meet the relevant criteria are offered places at the
Western Cape Sport School (WCSS).
Eleven selected MOD participants were enrolled at the school at the
beginning of 2014.
The Sport School continues to deliver top class performance and is actively supporting the best
young athletes to reach significant sporting achievements.
In accordance with the National Sport and Recreation Plan, DCAS has assisted the establishment of Indigenous
Games Committees in all six geo-political districts of the Western Cape.
This has created a tremendous amount of excitement and enthusiasm within local communities. 18
DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND SPORT - ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN 2014/2015
Terms of reference have been developed to assist these district structures with the necessary support for:
4. Establishing teams;
Putting effective management in place;
Incorporating good governance from the outset; and
Encouraging the relevant district and local municipality to embrace its sport and recreation responsibilities as described in the NSRP.
The DCAS/WCED Joint Provincial Task Team which oversees the delivery of school sport has shifted its emphasis
from multi-code to single-code sport structures with the relevant code federation being recognised as the
custodian of each type of sport.
The agreement provides that WCED is responsible for intra- and inter-school
leagues and DCAS is responsible for district and provincially representative teams.
Learners are invited to attend the Western Cape Sport School after having been identified as promising athletes
during Sharp Centre activities, school sport district trials and district federation trials.
Sharp Centres are aimed at creating high performance opportunities in sport, arts and culture and recreation activities for talented learners
identified at MOD Centres.
DCAS has supported cycling as a key sport for promoting a healthy lifestyle.
Led by the MEC, the West Coast
Cycling Federation was launched at an event in Vredenburg, setting the stage for greater youth involvement in the sport.
There has been an explosion of interest in chess in certain areas with the MEC being actively involved
in promoting the game.
Netball received supported in all regions and the result has been greater participation
of women in sport in the Western Cape.
Four regional workshops took place with federations and sport participants to promote drug-free sport.
DCAS supported a number of festivals which emphasised youth involvement in sport in Mossel Bay, Oudtshoorn,
Knysna and Velddrift and was a key player in a range of other sporting events in the Western Cape.
The Farm Workers Day is an annual event organised by DCAS where farm workers from a number of areas
compete in various sporting codes.
The games also serve to bring together and unite workers from different
farms.
The Department has developed a strong working relationship with the Farm Workers Association and
supports its activities with development funding.
DCAS has launched two district sporting academies - in Saldanha and in Oudtshoorn.
It has continued its
support to clubs in various sport codes with 415 clubs having benefitted so far.
Support to clubs takes the form of
capacity building as well as, financial assistance for transport to games and tournaments.
Successful programmes were held during Youth Month and Womens Month, and on Heritage Day, Disability
Day and World AIDS Day.
The current focus is on supporting the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against
Women and Children campaign.
An anti-gang programme using street football and netball is a key contribution to reducing crime in hotspot
communities. These efforts also contribute to creating job opportunities.
In addition to its staff establishment
DCAS employed 534 people to assist with the implementation of its various sport and recreation programmes, projects and events.
A number of youth camps with sport adventure themes took place in the Western Cape in 2013 at which
participants were given sport clothing and training.
A total of 336 youth participated in weekend regional
recruitment camps organised around the themes of social inclusion, nation building and leadership.
A total of
300 young people selected at provincial recruitment camps held across South Africa then attended a week-
long national youth camp. DCAS played a key role in organising the Better Together Games of the Western Cape Government.
This provided
opportunities for public servants to engage in a variety of sport activities, thereby building their interest in sport
and in living a healthy lifestyle.
DCASs case for sport research provides an evidence-based argument for the socio-economic benefit of
increasing operational and budgetary support to sport and recreation.
It also provides important information for
government, the private sector and NGOs on ways of maximising the beneficial impact of investing time, money
and other resources in the sector.
The research also describes how sport and recreation is linked to meeting the
12 National Strategic Outcomes and the 12 Provincial Strategic Objectives (PSOs).
Additional funding has been made available for sport federations which will assist in nation-building and
social inclusion.

Performance and expenditure trends
The growth in the provision for compensation of employees is attributed to the improvement of conditions of
service.
Goods and services increased as a result of additional funding for the EPWP programme and an addi-
tional allocation towards the establishment of the first Western Cape regional museum.
The increase in transfer
payments is attributed to funding for the EPWP programme, and reprioritisation of the budget.

objects that are used by many members of the public every day.
Mitigation strategy: The Library Service is rolling out book detection systems to public libraries.
Radio frequency
identification (RFID) is being investigated to assist with the management of library materials as assets.
Risk 3: The Archives building in Roeland Street, Cape Town is running out of space to store archival public records with enduring value.
This will have a negative impact on the safekeeping of the records.
Mitigation strategy: Engagement is continuing with Provincial Treasury and the Department of Transport and
Public Works for funding to extend the Roeland Street building.
Risk 4: The physical deterioration of historical records, some of which date from 1651.
This deterioration is caused
by a variety of factors, including the age of the records, as well as ongoing physical handling of the records by
staff and clients.

DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND SPORT - ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN 2014/2015
The measures described below are planned by the Archive Services in the 2014/15 financial year.
In order to strengthen records management capabilities in governmental bodies, it is necessary to ensure
implementation of best practice records classification systems.
Training courses will be presented to records
management staff in governmental bodies to improve the management of public records.
In order to implement systematic disposal programmes in governmental bodies, records with enduring value will be
identified in advance to ensure they are transferred into archival custody at an appropriate time.
The WCG Transversal ECM (Enterprise Content Management) Implementation Project was initiated in the
2013/14 financial year.
ECM provides centralised storage and access to information as well as correspondence
tracking across all provincial departments.
The implementation of ECM will bring about fundamental changes
in the execution of business processes and procedures aimed at enhancing efficiency, accountability and
transparency.
The mainstreaming of ECM in the Western Cape Government will enable DCAS, as provincial
custodian of records management, to enforce the provincial records management policy.
Digitisation of archival holdings will meet the needs of clients and promote democratisation by providing
electronic access to archival records.
The digitisation of the material held at the Western Cape Archives will take
place using the WCG-approved OpenText Content Server software.
Operational records will also be scanned.
New technology is changing the archivists profession, and internal training programmes will continue to
improve the professional skills of staff.
Policies, practices and guidelines will be developed to improve services to clients and to implement
international archival and records management best practice.
Providing archival records to researchers in the reading room will continue under the applicable rules and
procedures.
This will maintain the crucial link between the past and the present.
The partnership with the Genealogical Society of Utah to digitise archival records will continue.
Outreach activities will be rolled out to communities, to educate a wider public and to play a critical role
in supporting an open opportunity society.
The youth is a key target group to support the WCG to reach its
goals in respect of social inclusion.
Participation in the National Automated Archival Retrieval Information System (NAAIRS) will continue.
Participation in the service delivery improvement plan will continue by registering all researchers on an
electronic database to facilitate communication with them.
The Western Cape Archives and Records Service will cooperate closely with the newly established Archives
Advisory Committee.

Performance and expenditure trends
Since the inception of Conditional Grant funding in 2007/08, the Western Cape has received substantial amounts
for the enhancement of library services.
This funding has been used for additional staff at public libraries, Internet
connectivity, wheelie wagons (mobile libraries), upgrading and maintenance of libraries, and literacy projects.
The expenditure has been very well managed with an annual utilisation of almost 100% of the funding.
For
2014/15, the allocation increased substantially by 88.4% to R126.347 million.
Municipal replacement funding was initiated in the 2011/12 Adjusted Appropriation for Vulnerable B3 Munici-
palities to supplement municipal investment and to sustain the future professional delivery and development
of public library services in these jurisdictions.
The allocation for this purpose is R56.627 million in 2014/15, R60.617
million in 2015/16 and R65.006 million in 2016/17 (funded from the Provincial Equitable Share).
This programme received R30.6m, R38.475 million, R38.475 million and R18.521 million in 2014/15, 2015/16 and
2016/17 respectively for the Enterprise Content Management function.
The funds are allocated under the Sub-
programme 3.3: Archives.
The growth in the provision for compensation of employees is attributed to improvement of conditions of service.
Goods and services increased by inflation target of 5.4%.

Alcohol
Harms Reduction
Confronting alcohol-related harms
in our province
Adapted from the Western Cape Alcohol-Related Harms
Reduction Policy Green Paper
We need change.
Alcohol is destroying our communities,
but your ideas and comments can help change this.
Closing date for comment 14 December 2016.
Help us improve our policies and reduce the harms caused
by alcohol BETTER TOGETHER.
Our problem
Alcohol causes more damage to our communities than we realise,
and there is a lack of support to fix the damage caused.
Our existing laws and policies focus on the regulations of licensing, production,
distribution and sale of alcohol, but do not address the impact and
consequences of alcohol-related harms on society.
Alcohol is the most commonly abused drug countrywide.
In 2013, it
was recognised as the third leading risk factor for death and disability
in South Africa, following unsafe sex and obesity.
Its also a dominant
substance of abuse in the Western Cape.
Cases of foetal alcohol
spectrum disorder recorded in the Western Cape are among the
highest in the country.
35.2% of Western Cape learners in
grades 8 to11 binge drink  more
than any other province.
7-10% of our GDP or R165-236
billion is the estimated loss to
South Africas economy due to
alcohol-related harms.
70% of crimes in our communities
are linked to substance abuse.
67% of domestic violence in our
communities is alcohol related.
70% of trauma victims in our
hospitals test positive for alcohol.
18-26% of Grade 1 learners in certain
high-risk communities showed
signs of foetal alcohol spectrum
disorder.
Alcohol-related
harms destroy lives, tear apart
limit socio-economic
development - but
there is a lack of
support for effective
interventions to reduce alcohol-
related harms.
In a 2013 survey of
more than 1 700 adults in
Khayelitsha, Gugulethu
and Nyanga, 75 - 80% of
respondents agreed on
restricted availability,
increased pricing and
better enforcement
measures for alcohol; 65%
of participants supported
increased restrictions
on alcohol marketing.
Older adults were more
supportive of earlier
closing times of bars, an
older purchasing age,
as well as an increase
in pricing and taxes of alcohol.
The Western Cape Alcohol-
Related Harms Reduction
Policy Green Paper is the
first step towards making
our communities safer and
our opportunities greater.
Our eight key focus
areas are based on the
recommendations made
by the World Health
Organisation:
1.
Pricing and economy
2.
Enforcement
3.
Alcohol and road environment
4.
Health and social services
5.
Community-based action
6.
Education and awareness
7.
Information, data
collection, monitoring and evaluation
8.
Institutional
arrangements
Encourage a national ban on
alcohol advertising that is
visible to anyone under the
age of 18, and restrict sports
advertising and promotion
that links alcohol to success.
Advertising, marketing and
the promotion of alcohol at
all public facilities and events
organised by the WCG should
be prohibited.
Encourage levies on
promotional spending to
cover alcohol-related harms
counter messaging.
Budget for alcohol-related
harms and communication
action interventions at all
public health and social
service facilities.
Consider the possibility of
maximum limits for trading
hours/days to reduce
availability and consumption.
Pricing and
economy
The alcohol sector contributes
to our economy.
A recent study
showed that the production and
sale of alcohol contributed R93.2
billion to the economy or 3.9% to
GDP.
This contribution is important,
especially in the Western Cape,
but the cost of alcohol-related
harms outweighs the contribution.
The financial cost of alcohol to the
economy was estimated as a net
loss of R245-280 billion or 10-12%
of GDP.
The number of
licensed liquor outlets
in the Western Cape
in December 2015
was 9 296.
A number
of concerns emanate
from the unlicensed
and illicit liquor sector,
such as a lack of
regulation leading
to increased harm
and the loss of tax
and licence revenue
that can be used to
mitigate harms.
Regulate the amount of outlets
in each area based on zoning
requirements and population.
Enable the rezoning of outlets
for liquor sales in appropriate
residential areas.
Encourage the increase of alcohol
Pinpoint the supply chain of the
pricing through excise tax or
minimum unit pricing.
Encourage the reduction of
ethanol content in alcoholic
beverages.
Increase enforcement of
under-age drinking regulations.
Bring responsible unlicensed liquor
outlets into the regulated market
in a sustainable and responsible
manner. unlicensed liquor industry.
Spread awareness of alternative
economic opportunities to
unlicensed outlet owners.
Capacitate enforcement units
through resourcing and an
integrated liquor enforcement
approach.
Enforcement is a combination of
compliance and law enforcement. It
ensures that liquor licence holders
and applicants follow the law, and
that those who dont are punished
according to it.
All spheres of government should
work together to clamp down on
unlicensed outlets and the supply
of liquor to these unlicensed liquor outlets.
Arrange hotlines to promote the
involvement of communities in
stopping unlicensed selling.
Increase and strengthen the
number of trained liquor law
enforcement officers in each
sphere of government to
work together, with additional
enforcement authority.
Establish one primary liquor
enforcement centre for
operational coordination.
Liquor licence requirements
should be adjusted to guarantee
that licence holders, and the
managers who will be on site,
are trained on the Western Cape
Liquor Act 2008.
Mobile testing for breath and
blood must be conducted by a
qualified provincial official with
an approved, legally admissible
device at all Western Cape
roadblocks. Alcohol
and road
environment
Numerous reports and
studies on Western Cape
road fatalities, particularly in
Cape Town, have shown the
prevalence of alcohol.
Place liquor licensing
restrictions in areas
with high occurrences
of alcohol-related road
trauma.
Place restrictions on the
sale of alcohol at outlets on
national or provincial roads.
Encourage a stricter
alcohol limit and/or zero
tolerance licensing system
for young or new drivers.
Place an alcohol limit on
certain classes of road
for pedestrians, between
certain hours.
Introduce alcohol-detecting
(vehicle starting system
to the
vehicles of certain drivers.
Support and strengthen
random breath testing.
Health and social services play a critical role in all
prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services
for individuals with alcohol-related conditions.
Improve access to treatment services for
alcohol-related conditions.
Encourage prevention, early intervention,
detoxification and aftercare.
Provide evidence-based interventions at
antenatal clinics to reduce alcohol-exposed
pregnancies.
Promote early screening and referral services
at schools in high-risk areas.
Expand specialised treatment services and
interventions for youth at care centres.
Community-based action
Substance abuse affects an individuals health as
well as their family, community and workplace.
Treatment should therefore not only focus on the
individual, but also on their environment.
Expand the community-based model for
substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation.
Coordinate integrated community
programmes.
Leverage neighbourhood watch structures to
assist in gathering and spreading information.
Increase community input in the management
of social disruptions linked to liquor outlets.
Education and awareness
We support a whole-of-society approach to education and awareness.
We aim
to educate the public about the negative consequences of harmful alcohol use
and mobilise support to reduce these harms.
Strengthen education and awareness interventions.
Leverage the after-school space for education and awareness programmes.
Promote and strengthen education and awareness programmes to
stakeholders.
Improve the reach and ease of access to education and awareness material.
Information, data collection, monitoring
and evaluation
The efficient and coordinated collection, management, analysis and sharing
of alcohol-related information is vital to monitor and evaluate the trends and
impact of interventions.
Establish a three-tier (national, provincial and local) governmental structure to
collect alcohol-related information and data for monitoring and evaluation.
Institutional arrangements
These arrangements include policies, systems and processes.
Institutional
arrangements should focus on cooperation across all spheres of government,
relevant departments and role players, and support effective measures to
reduce alcohol-related harms.
Shift the administrative burden and cost of liquor licence applications from
the South African Police Service, municipalities and the Western Cape Liquor
Association to the applicant.
Introduce a relationship between liquor licensing, trading hours, lighting and
pedestrian infrastructure to promote safer spaces.
The change we
need
The way forward involves regulating alcohol in terms of its
consumption and its consequences, using a whole-of-society approach.
We all need to play our part to make this work.
Alcohol continues to be a product that is often abused, which
causes substantial harm.
Our communities, especially our youth, are at risk.
We have laws in place to regulate the licensing, production,
distribution and sale of alcohol, but these laws fail to recognise the
impact and consequences of alcohol on society.
We need to act.
A new policy will rewrite these laws and regulations, and change
the way the Western Cape will function in terms of alcohol.
We
are doing this to protect the rights of individuals, families and
communities and to ensure that all of our people are able to make
the most of their opportunities.
The policy aims to provide a balanced regulation of alcohol
which reduces the harm caused by alcohol in communities, whilst
continuing to acknowledge its contribution to agriculture and the
economy.
Public participation has begun, and we will continue to
gather information from communities to create a policy that works.
The closing date for comment is 14 December 2016.
Alcohol has no conscience, but you do.
Tumis story
Its a warm Sunday evening.
Tumis research project is due first thing
tomorrow morning.
Thankfully, her home is peaceful and quiet.
She remembers
spending hours trying to finish her assignments through the noise and
commotion from the tavern next door.
She used to work through the night
sometimes, ignoring drunken knocks on her bedroom window and lingering
voices that followed footsteps outside.
Since the tavern closed, life has been very different for Tumi.
She dreams of
running a rehab programme for alcohol-dependant community members or
maybe even an online community magazine to support local entrepreneurs.
As the last school bell rings, Mr Martins remembers a time when his students
used to rush out, with no place to go and nothing to do except stand on street
corners or hang around at the local shop.
Instead, he now enjoys the sight of
an after-school facility surrounded by green grass free of broken beer bottles lying around.
Mathematics and Language were the least popular subjects
back then, but thanks to the after-school centre, Maths and English are
considered very cool things to be good at.
He is particularly impressed with
the academic improvement of one of his students, Tumi, who plans to be an
entrepreneur. Aunty Lorna sits quietly along the pavement, waiting for her first customer.
Shes been a fruit vendor for 25 years and has set up her shop before the crack
of dawn every day.
Shes been robbed many times in the dark, and been hit by
a drunk driver.
As a piece of fruit rolls on to the ground, she reaches over to
pick it up.
Hi there, my name is Tumi.
Im doing some research for school and Id like to ask you a question: Why have
you chosen this job?
Aunty Lorna breathes a sigh of relief, realising that she
is safe on the streets now, I never had many opportunities, and so I grow and
sell my own fruit to support my family.
Mr Martins watches Tumi assisting one of her peers; he recalls a time when
Tumi was one of the more withdrawn students.
He asked her what had changed.
My life changed when my father died an alcoholic.
My family never helped him through his addiction.
I knew then that life is an opportunity for us
to help one other, replied Tumi.
As they all return home from a long day at work and school, they appreciate
the comfort of safety on the roads and walkways.
A few years earlier, danger
lurked behind every corner. Times have changed.
Better yet, these changes
have brought them together.

Health infrastructure delivery
The Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works delivers
infrastructure and services to the people of the province to promote positive
socio-economic outcomes and safe, empowered and connected communities.
The new R35 million psychiatric services building currently under construction at the Paarl Hospital is scheduled for completion in March 2016.
This facility will provide specialised infrastructural capacity to attend to the needs of the increasing numbers of psychiatric patients coming to the
hospital.
Features include a new 30-bed ward (17 beds for men, 10 for women and the remainder for specialised services), as well as day areas for living
and rehabilitation, outdoor areas that include courtyards and verandas, four consulting rooms, and a number of service areas.
When it is complete, the new building will expand patient access to multi-disciplinary care at Paarl Hospital.
This is another example of the commitment
of the Department and its partners to providing quality infrastructure to all the people of the Western Cape.
We lead in the delivery of government infrastructure and related services better toGetHer.

The National
Anthem
The National Anthem was proclaimed
in 1997 and is a shortened, combined
version of two anthems (Nkosi Sikelel
iAfrica and the Call of South Africa /
Die Stem van Suid Afrika).
It is unique
in that it is sung in four languages.
This
demonstrates the tireless desire South
Africans have to reconcile and promote
national unity.
Die Stem van Suid-Afrika is a poem
written by CJ Langenhoven in May
1818, with music composed in 1921 by
the Reverend M L de Villiers. It was
rst sung publicly at the of cial raising
of the National Flag in Cape Town on
31 May 1928 but it was not until 2 May
1957 that government pronounced Die
Stem as the of cial national anthem of
South Africa.
In 1952 the of cial English
version, The Call of South Africa was
accepted for of cial use.
Nkosi Sikelel iAfrica was composed
in 1897 by Enoch Sontonga, a Methodist
Mission School teacher.
The poet Samuel
Mqhayi later added seven additional
stanzas in Xhosa.
A Sesotho version was
published by Moses Mphalele in 1942.
Nkosi Sikelel iAfrica became a popular
church hymn that was later adopted
as an anthem at political meetings and
was sung as an act of de ance during
the apartheid years.
The  rst stanza is
generally sung in isiXhosa and isiZulu
followed by the Sesotho stanza.
The National Anthem should be
recited with appropriate respect.
When the anthem is sung all should
stand up straight and pay attention.
Civilians should take their headgear
off as a sign of respect.
The National Orders
The National Orders are the highest awards that
the country, through its President, can bestow
on individual South Africans and eminent
foreign leaders and personalities.
From 27 April
2001 new, radically different National Orders
were unveiled.
Their designs contain indigenous

FOREWORD BY THE CHAIRPERSON
The financial year 2013/14 has been a year of transition for Heritage Western Cape
(HWC) seeing the expiry of the term of its third Council and the appointment of a
new Council which will serve until end of August 2016.
Whilst there are several
familiar faces on the fourth Council, there are many new members who have,
through their early contributions, already shown themselves to have added
considerable value to serving the heritage of the province.
Laura Robinson
New committees for the organisation were also appointed early in the term of the
new Council. Having learned from experience, the outgoing Council acted
responsibly by approving a policy which sought to ensure that the transition period
for committees was managed with the least possible disruption to serving the
public. In order to achieve this, the incoming Council reappointed the existing committees under new
chairpersons for a short interim period to allow enough time for new members to be recruited and
appointed.
This ensured that the members of the committees, which are effectively the workhorses of
the organisation, were selected after the new Council had had a few months to settle in and the new
chairpersons had become familiar with the ambit and responsibilities of their committees.
Whilst it has
been resolved that the policy should be reviewed before the expiry of the term of the present Council,
it is generally felt that this system is better than the previous practice which was for an incoming Council
to appoint committees at its first meeting.
The most notable trend in the workload of HWC over the past year has been an increase of almost 60%
in the number of applications received and processed.
This apparent upturn in the construction industry
has presented a challenge to an organisation which has suffered staff shortages during the past two
years. The number of professional heritage officers is less than half of what it was.
Nevertheless, it is due
to the hard work of both staff and committee members that HWC was able to manage this
considerable increase in its workload.
It is hoped that, in the 2014/15 financial year, the Western Cape Government, as the employer of the
staff of HWC, will have resolved current challenges in respect of recruitment.
The present recruitment
system creates considerable operational stress and a negative impact on the quality of service offered
to the public.
It also causes difficulties for recruitment in a sector where skills are scarce.
The slow
recruitment process too often results in the loss of good candidates to other employers.
Given the increase in applications, workload and the challenging staff situation, the past year has been
one in which the organisation has been able to undertake very little work other than processing
applications.
Managing these increased pressures would not have been possible without great dedication on the
part of the members of the present and previous Council, their standing committees, and a very
dedicated staff.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to all of our colleagues, as well
as the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport (DCAS) which provides HWC with ongoing support,
most notably in the field of financial management.
A special word of thanks is due to our outgoing
Minister, Dr Ivan Meyer, who has during his term of office been an enthusiastic and dedicated
supporter of our work.
On behalf of HWC, I would like to wish him well with his new responsibilities in the

4 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OVERVIEW
The past year was one in which the bulk of expenditure of the organisation has, in line
with service delivery targets, been largely dedicated to support of the Council and its
committees.
The bulk of the work associated with such disbursements is for the most
part associated with the processing of applications.
During the year under review,
processing of applications was the only major area of activity to which Heritage
Western Cape was able to attend.
All targets in the Annual Performance Plan have been met or exceeded.
Andrew Hall
Whilst there was some expectation at the start of the year that other activities might
be possible, for reasons associated with major growth in the number of applications
received and with the slow pace of recruitment of new staff, this proved, for the most
part, to be impossible.
The growth in applications over the three-year financial planning cycle has, as previously reported, led
to reviews of work methods and improvements in efficiency.
However, the large increase in
applications in the 2013/14 year led to serious consideration of how technology in the form of an
information management system (IMS) could relieve the organisation of part of its administrative
burden.
At financial year-end, a contract for the development of such a system had been advertised
and funds identified for its development.
As a measure aimed in part to relieve workload, HWCs volunteer programme, initiated last year, has
become better established.
Without the assistance of students and young graduates seeking
experience in the heritage resources sector, the organisation would not have achieved its targets for
the year. During the course of 2013/14, HWC opened an investment account and money set aside for the IMS
project and other purposes has been invested at a competitive rate.
The initial amount envisaged for
this purpose has been supplemented by income from application fees which HWC started to levy, in
line with the practice of other heritage resources authorities.
Subsequent to the reporting date, a claim for R26 574 804 was lodged against HWC, DCAS and its
Ministry on 8 May 2014.
The claim was lodged by Midnight Storm Investments 170 (Pty) Ltd and arises
from the refusal of an application under section 27 of the NHRA which was first submitted in the 2011/12
financial year and finally refused on appeal to the Tribunal appointed by the Minister on 21 November
2013.
In conclusion, I take this opportunity to thank the members of the previous HWC Council for their service
and dedication over the triennium and welcome the new Council which has already shown its
willingness to take forward the work of its predecessor in the same spirit.
Many thanks also go to each
one of our staff, volunteers and committee members who served the organisation with great
dedication and rose to the challenges of what has been a testing year. The support and advice of my
colleagues in the senior management team of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport in all
manner of issues pertaining to HWC is, as always, much appreciated.
In this regard I single out the CFO
and her public entities support staff.
I would also like to express my appreciation to our outgoing
Minister, Dr Ivan Meyer, and his Head of Ministry Adv. Estienne Pretorius.
Their support and guidance
during the year under review was much appreciated.
Chief Executive Officer:
STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AND CONFIRMATION OF ACCURACY OF THE ANNUAL REPORT
To the best of my knowledge and belief, I confirm the following:
Financial Statements audited by the Auditor-General.
The Annual Report is complete, accurate and is free from any omissions.
The Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines on the annual report
as issued by National Treasury.
The Annual Financial Statements (Part E) have been prepared in accordance with the GRAP
standards applicable to Heritage Western Cape.
The Accounting Authority is responsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements
and for the judgements made in this information.

of Appeal

The judgement deals with the inadmissibility of a late
appeal as well as the importance of authenticity and
integrity; the irrelevance of romantic and sentimental
attachment to heritage that has lost significance; and the
need to demonstrate how ones rights are affected by the
issuing of a permit one is opposed to.
This judgment had a profound impact on the appeal
processes of the tribunals appointed by the MEC in terms
of section 49 of the National Heritage Resources Act, 1999,
read with Regulation 12 of PN 336 of 2003.
DCAS and the
MEC took corrective steps to ensure fair administrative
processes and make provision for the admission of new
evidence into the record of a tribunal process, as well as
better compliance with the rules of natural justice in terms
of the audi alteram partem maxim.
This judgment sets out what constitutes adequate
consultation with local communities and other
stakeholders in respect of proposed changes to
geographical names.
DCAS and the Western Cape
Provincial Geographical Names Committee established by
the MEC are important role-players in the implementation
of the relevant legislation, especially with respect to the
facilitation of consultation with stakeholders and
communities.
They must take this judgment into account in
the processes and procedures they use to manage
proposed changes to geographical names.

The Auditor-General of South Africa currently performs the necessary audit procedures on the
performance information to provide reasonable assurance in the form of an audit conclusion.
The audit conclusion on the performance against predetermined objectives is included in the report to
management, with material findings being reported under the Predetermined Objectives heading in
the Report on other legal and regulatory requirements section of the auditors report.
Refer to page 39-41 of the Auditors Report, published as Part E: Financial Information.
2 SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS
Service delivery environment
The major feature of the service delivery environment has been staff shortages caused by long delays
in recruitment.
This has made the 2013/14 financial year an extremely difficult one for staff
management and the committees of Heritage Western Cape.
The professional staff responsible for the
bulk of effort involved in processing of applications fell from eight to three and it was only under
extremely stressful conditions that performance targets were met and the mandate of the organisation
to process applications within stipulated timeframes met.
This achievement has to be viewed in the
light of a growth in the number of applications received of almost 60%, given improved economic
conditions in the construction sector of the economy.
In this regard, the organisation was assisted by an
archaeologist appointed on contract from mid-July and in the last quarter by two volunteers, one a
town planning student who could not find a paid internship and the second an archaeology honours
graduate seeking professional experience in heritage conservation.
These volunteers work four days per
week.
One of the biggest difficulties arising from the staffing situation has made it almost impossible for
Heritage Western Cape to provide much-needed advice and assistance to applicants who cannot
afford the services of professional heritage professionals.
The absence of a qualified architect on the
staff since the end of November has been a particular concern.
Given the improving economic
situation for such professionals, it is unlikely that on present salary scales an architect can be recruited.
This became clear when the entry level candidate identified to fill a vacant Heritage Officer Built
Environment position declined the position in large part due to the salary offered.
2.2 Organisational environment
The offices of HWC are situated on the 3rd Floor in Protea Assurance Building, Greenmarket Square in
Cape Town within the offices of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport.
Being centrally situated in
Cape Town, the office provides an easily accessible front desk for clients who hand in applications
there and receive advice and other information from professional staff.
At the time of reporting,
negotiations concerning a move to the Old Standard Bank Building on Adderley Street, Cape Town
were at an advanced stage and the move had been announced by the MEC.
It is planned that office
space there will be shared with the provincial Museum Service.

authority, the bulk of the work of HWC still comprises the processing of applications under the terms of
Chapter II of the Act.
11 number of applications received and staff shortages meant that few activities other than processing
applications could be undertaken. The number of applications processed in the course of the year
amounted to 3 297, exceeding 3 000 for the first time.
This constitutes a growth of 57.6% on the 2 092

In addition to the above, the organisation also dealt with 482 other queries not directly related to
processing of applications.
2.2.2
Appeals
In the course of the year, 12 appeals were heard by the Appeals Committee.
Whilst there were 25%
fewer appeals relative in the preceding year, relative to the increase in the number of applications
processed there has in fact been a decrease with the ratio declining from 1:233 in 2012/13 to 1:275 in
the year under review.
At the commencement of the term of office of the new Council, it was resolved to reconfigure the
membership of the Appeals Committee in order to better ensure that the necessary expertise was
brought to bear on appeals and to avoid situations where in the past it had proven difficult to obtain a
quorum due to committee members having to recuse themselves due to conflicts of interest most often
brought about by their having served on the committee that had made the decision being appealed.
The Council hence resolved that all members of the Council should be appointed as members of the
Appeals Committee and that as required in terms of regulations at least two of them should be present
at an appeal.
Three experts who are not members of the Council make up the balance of membership
of the committee.
2.2.3 Consideration of inventories of the national estate
During the course of the year the review of the Drakenstein Municipalitys inventory of heritage
resources was finalised.
New inventories of the national estate were received for two areas falling within the Stellenbosch
Municipality, one for the historic core of Stellenbosch and other for the University of Stellenbosch.
An
inventory for Church Street, Tulbagh in the Witzenberg Municipality was also received.
At year-end
these and the George Municipal inventory submitted in the previous financial year were still under
consideration.
The Church Street, Tulbagh inventory is the second to have been submitted by a registered
conservation body, and represents a positive trend where communities are taking responsibility for
identifying important heritage resources.
The process of reviewing the inventory of the City of Cape Town (CoCT) continues with completion
expected during the course of 2016.
Amendments to the Swartland Municipal inventory, submitted in
2011, are still awaited.
13 The submission of inventories is important for a number of reasons.
They form the basis for identification
of sites for formal protection in terms of Part 1 of Chapter II of the NHRA and in grading sites, assist HWC
and local government to understand the relative values of heritage resources.
With regard to the latter,
the submission of inventories has greatly assisted the organisation with the grading of former national
monuments and their subsequent marking with badges indicating their status as provincial heritage
sites.
This is particularly true of the Drakenstein Municipality in which all former national monuments have now been graded.
Above all, the purpose of an inventory shows the presence of heritage resources within physical space
and this contributes greatly to the ability of those planning development to avoid conflict with the
heritage resources authorities and to use the presence of heritage resources to their advantage where
possible.
They are hence invaluable as the means to resolve tensions between heritage conservation
on the one hand and the need for development on the other.
Inventories are also an important first step in identifying areas for protection as heritage areas in terms
of both Section 31 of the NHRA and municipal zoning schemes. Several such areas have been
identified in the inventories already approved and this is an area that requires follow-up with the
municipalities concerned.
2.2.4
Declaration of provincial heritage sites and issuing of badges
On 29 November 2013, the Saron Mission Station in the village of Saron was declared as a provincial
heritage site in recognition of its historical significance as an early mission, its association with a
community of freed slaves, and its architectural merits.
A badge indicating the status of the site was
unveiled by Dr Ivan Meyer during a commemoration service in the mission church on Sunday 1
December 2013, the date of the 175th anniversary of the emancipation of slaves in the former Cape
Colony.
In the course of the year under review, HWC issued 63 badges for the marking of provincial heritage
sites.
These included the newly declared Saron Mission, as well as former national monuments which have been graded.
The bulk of the latter were in the Drakenstein Municipality flowing from the
submission of the municipal inventory and Clanwilliam, where HWC staff conducted a grading exercise.
2.2.5 Other activities involving local government
During the course of 2013/14, there has been ongoing discussion with the CoCT around the issue of
devolution of powers.
The matter stalled around apparent contradictions in measures concerning
appeals processes set out in the NHRA and the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, 2000. By
March 2014 this issue seemed to have been resolved and the process was once again moving forward.
2.2.6
Heritage Month  Wiki Loves Monuments project
Once again HWC sponsored Western Cape activities of the Wiki Loves Monuments project.
This initiative
of Wikipedia is now in its fourth year of existence and the second to include South Africa.
It is the worlds
largest photographic competition.
Through use of the Internet and cell phone technology, the
competition is attractive to youth and involves them in a project to record heritage sites.
This provides a
record of heritage resources that is invaluable to heritage authorities.
A total of 6 432 South African
photographs were uploaded during the course of September 2013 and HWC has now entered into a
three-year sponsorship agreement with WikiMedia South Africa.
The highest placed Western Cape photograph, which came in third in the national competition, is on
the cover of this report.
It was taken by former HWC staffer now turned professional photographer, Chris
Snelling who also came third in the 2012 competition.
2.2.7
Digitisation
The ongoing Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP)-funded project to digitise the records of HWC
and its predecessors made steady progress with all incoming submissions that were not received in
electronic form being scanned and stored.
The project employs four young people.
In addition, a total
of 7 472 of the 15 576 records in the Registry have now been scanned.
After considerable consideration and discussion with SAHRA, HWC resolved not to participate in
SAHRIS (South African Heritage Resources Information System) project.
This decision was taken on the
basis of several factors, one being the need to integrate with other systems at provincial and municipal
level, in particular with the provincial Museum Service and CoCTs Integrated Spatial Information
System (ISIS) and the advantages of becoming part of the Western Cape Governments enterprise
content management (ECM) project which is being piloted in DCAS and from which HWC will derive
HERITAGE WESTERN CAPE  ANNUAL REPORT 2013/14 14
considerable benefit.
There were also concerns that given that the bulk of the workload of HWC is in
the processing of applications, and the large numbers of applications received, downtime and other
service delivery issues concerning SAHRIS over which HWC would not have control could severely
hamper effective service delivery.
At financial year-end, HWC had entered into an agreement with DCAS to develop an information
management system (IMS) for use by itself and the Museum Service and a bid in terms of an existing
SITA contract had been advertised.
The system that will commence development in the new financial
year is provisionally known as HIMS  Heritage Information Management System.
It is seen as a key
project that will enable online application under the NHRA and will automate many functions currently
being performed manually.
These functions are in addition to data processing functions and document storage and access.
It is expected that the system will make the 15 500 files of HWC easily accessible to
the public and will free up professional staff to concentrate more specifically on the functions for which
they are employed.
Key policy developments and legislative changes
2.3.1
Policy development
A new policy on appointment of committees was developed early in the financial year and greatly
assisted in the transition period after the new Council of Heritage Western Cape took office on 1
September 2013.
In contrast to the past where at its first meeting the new Council had to appoint
committees in order to allow the work of organisation to continue uninterrupted, the policy allows
existing committees to continue in office for a transitional period during which applications to serve on
committees are considered and appointments made once the new Council has become familiar with
Following on from an initiative taken at the commencement of the term of office of the last Council, all
the legislation, regulations, policies, guidelines and manuals applying to the core mandates of the
organisation were compiled into a handbook, a hard copy of which was given to each member of the
new Council and to staff in September.
A digital version of the document has been widely distributed
and is regularly updated as changes are made.
2.3.2
Legal matters
Whilst there were no amendments to legislation or regulations, several legal opinions were sought
regarding interpretations of the NHRA and these have assisted to clarify approaches to areas of
uncertainty on the part of both HWC and those who submit applications to the organisation.
There
were also several occasions on which HWC used its powers to stop what it regarded as illegal work and
a court case is in process.
The major issues are discussed in greater detail below.
Legal opinion on PAIA applications
Legal opinion was sought on situations where a PAIA application made by HWC receives no response
within the required period of time.
It was established that in such an instance the application is deemed
to have been refused.
Legal opinion on amendment of a gazette notice declaring a provincial heritage site
The procedure for amending notices was clarified.
Legal opinion on late appeals
It was established that appeals lodged after the 14 working day limit cannot be processed even if
argument is made that the reason relates to a procedural error on the part of HWC.
The recourse in
such instances is judicial review.
Legal opinion on Supreme Court of Appeal judgement
The impacts of the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment in the Qualidental Laboratories vs Heritage
Western Cape and one other case was clarified concerning the nature of alterations and additions
under which application in terms of Section 34 of the NHRA should be required.
HERITAGE WESTERN CAPE  ANNUAL REPORT 2013/14
15 Legal opinion on extension of permits
The wording of regulations governing the extension of permits was clarified, it being established that a
permit could be extended for a further three years and not to a maximum of three years if the permit
Klein Konstantia, Paarl
This matter concerns work conducted on a provincial heritage site allegedly in contravention of the
provisions of the permit issued by HWC.
The matter first came before the Paarl Magistrates Court on 7
February 2013 and has since been repeatedly postponed.
During the course of 2013, the magistrate
asked to be recused due to a conflict of interest.
A new magistrate was appointed and requested that
HWC and the accused attempt to negotiate a settlement of the matter.
At financial year-end a
discussion with the accused had not yet taken place.
Stop works orders
HWC has powers to stop work on a project in instances where it is believed that work is proceeding
outside of the parameters of the NHRA.
Stop works orders were issued in respect of a variety of sites
during the year under review.
Strategic outcome-oriented goals
Heritage Western Capes strategic outcome-oriented goal is to steer and manage the process of
transforming the heritage landscape of the Western Cape.
This involves identification, recording and
management of both tangible and intangible heritage resources as prescribed in the National Heritage
Resource Act, 1999. The approach to achieve the above is driven by the institutions operational values
which foreground inclusivity, accountability, transparency, enhancement of civic pride, excellence
and ethics.

organisation which concerns the processing of over 3 000 applications per annum.
This work is
undertaken by the staff teams and APM, IACOM and BELCOM committees of the Council.
The work of
these components of HWC hence reflects the major work effort of the organisation for the financial
year under review.
The work of the Council and Executive Committee reflect the bulk of the balance of
tasks undertaken by HWC in that these organs deal with matters relating to policy, declarations of sites,
approval of inventories and gradings and financial oversight.
Strategy to overcome areas of under performance
Regular monitoring on performance has left no room for underperformance.
Measures were put in
place to achieve performance on indicators.
Changes to planned targets
No changes were made during the period under review.

The process for collection of fees is set out in terms of a policy approved by the HWC Council.
Fees are
payable in advance of acceptance of an application and tracking of a payment through the system
is connected to the case number allocated to the application.
Due to the high growth in number of
applications received, income from fees has exceeded forecasts.
However, in the medium-term,
income from this source is expected to fall once the long-planned delegation of functions to the City of
Cape Town metropolitan municipality takes place.
In the 2013/14 financial year, 56% of all applications
received fell within the jurisdiction of the city.
In the future only a small proportion of these will still be
processed by HWC.
These will primarily be applications for provincial heritage sites under section 27 of
the NHRA.
It is anticipated that income from this source will fall by about 50%.

The Accounting Authority (AA) for the Heritage Western Cape (HWC), takes responsibility for
implementing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) in accordance with the National Treasury Public
Sector Risk Management Framework (NTPSRMF) and the Directorate Enterprise Risk Management
(D:ERM) in the Entity of the Premier (DoTP) provides a centralised strategic support service to the Entity.
In compliance with the National Treasury Public Sector Risk Management Framework (NTPSRMF) and to
further embed risk management within the Entity, the Western Cape Government (WCG) has adopted
an ERM Policy which sets out the WCGs overall intention with regard to ERM.
An Annual ERM Implementation Strategy has been developed in order to give effect to the WCG ERM
policy and to attain the Annual ERM Implementation Plan and the risk management priorities of the
Entity.
This enables the Entity to deliver on its goals, objectives and key performance indicators,
enhance risk informed decision making and optimise compliance with applicable legislation.
It further outlines the roles and responsibilities of managers and staff in embedding risk management in the Entity
and defines the enabling legislation, standards, mechanisms, tools and resources to be used to realise
the ERM plan.
The Fraud and Risk Management Committee (FARMCO) provides governance oversight over the entire
system of risk management of the Entity and furnishes the Accounting Authority with the requisite
reports in respect of performance of risk management.
The Audit Committee provides the independent
oversight of the Entitys system of risk management.
The Audit Committee is furnished with Quarterly
ERM progress reports and the Entities risk profiles and registers to execute their independent oversight
role. The Audit Committees evaluation of the risk management process is in relation to the progress of
implementation of the Entities Annual ERM Implementation Plan and significant/strategic risks faced by
the Entity and their relevant risk response/treatment strategies.
Fraud and Risk Management Committee (FARMCO) The Entity has established a FARMCO to assist the Accounting Authority in executing his respective
responsibilities concerned with risk management.

32 Risk management process
During the period under review, the Entity assessed its risks relative to its strategic and annual performance plan.
Risk assessments are conducted on a strategic level on an annual basis and
updated quarterly.
At a programme level the risk assessments are conducted on a quarterly basis in
order to review and update the existing risks and to identify emerging risks.
Significant risks relevant to
objectives were assessed in terms of its likelihood and impact; risk treatment plans are developed and
managed by allocated risk owners.
Programme risk registers are approved by the respective
programme manager.
The FARMCO ratifies, prioritises and further recommends to the Accounting Authority, which significant
risks are mitigated with an appropriate risk response/treatment in order to meet the Entities strategic
objectives. This process is conducted on a quarterly basis and feeds into the evaluation of the
performance environment of the Entity.
INTERNAL CONTROL UNIT
It is the responsibility of the Accounting Authority to continually assess and evaluate internal controls to
assure that the control activities in place are effective, efficient and transparent and updated when
necessary.
To achieve this, quarterly key control meetings were held with the Auditor-General,
programme managers of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport and the MEC.
This is an ongoing
process to ensure that the Entity obtains clean audits.
INTERNAL AUDIT AND AUDIT COMMITTEES
Internal Audit provides management with independent, objective assurance and consulting services
designed to add value and to continuously improve the operations of the Entity.
It should assist the
Entity to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and
improve the effectiveness of Governance, Risk Management and Control processes.
The following key
activities are performed in this regard:
achieving the Entitys objectives;
Evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness and contribute to the improvement of the risk
management process;
Assist the Accounting Authority in maintaining efficient and effective controls by evaluating those
controls to determine their effectiveness and efficiency, and by developing recommendations for
enhancement or improvement.
The Audit Committee is established as oversight bodies, providing independent oversight over
governance, risk management and control processes in the Entity, which include oversight and
responsibilities relating to:
Internal audit function;
External audit function as carried out by the Auditor-General of South Africa;
Entity accounting and reporting;
Entity accounting Policies;
Review of Auditor-General of South Africas management and audit report;

8 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Systems, policies and processes are in place to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
The Western Cape Government adopted an Anti-Corruption Strategy which confirms the Provinces
zero tolerance stance towards fraud and corruption.
The Entity has an approved Fraud Prevention Plan
and a Fraud Prevention Implementation plan which gives effect to the Fraud Prevention Plan.
Various channels for reporting allegations of fraud and corruption exist and these are described in
detail in the Provincial Anti-Corruption Strategy and the Entities Fraud Prevention Plan.
Each allegation
received by the Forensic Investigation Unit is recorded in a Case Management System which is used as
a management tool to report on progress made with cases relating to the Entity and generating
statistics for the Province and the Entity.
We protect employees who blow the whistle on suspicions of
fraud, corruption and theft if the disclosure is a protected disclosure (i.e. not malicious). The opportunity
to remain anonymous is afforded to any person who would like to report acts of fraud, theft and
corruption and should they do so in person, their identities are kept confidential by the person to whom
they are reporting.
Once fraud or corruption is confirmed after completion of an investigation, the relevant employee who
participated in these acts is subjected to a disciplinary hearing.
In all such instances, the WCG
representative initiating the disciplinary proceedings is required to recommend dismissal of the
employee concerned.
Where prima facie evidence of criminal conduct is detected, a criminal matter
is reported at the South African Police Services.
During this financial year, 1 investigation was completed by the Forensic Investigation Unit confirming
Fraud or Corruption.
At the end of the financial year, 2 matters remained on the case list of the Entity.
10 MINIMISING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Heritage Western Cape ensures that there are no conflicts of interest by insisting that a Declaration of
Interest (WCBD4 form) is obtained from every supplier not registered on the Western Cape Supplier
Database.
Before doing business with suppliers who are registered on the database, checks are done
to verify that their WCBD4 declarations are not more than 12 months old.
Provincial Treasury is assisting departments to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest where owners or
directors of companies are also public servants in the Western Cape. This is done by providing
information from PERSAL (the Personnel Salary System) about public servants who are registered as
owners or directors of companies.
The entity ensures that such persons possess a Remunerative Work
Outside the Public Service (RWOPS) approval letter before doing business with them.
The entity has not found any conflict of interest with any business concluded with suppliers. If such a
conflict were to be discovered, the matter will be treated as a fraudulent Supply Chain Management
activity and, after a due diligence investigation, the supplier will be identified as a non-preferred
service provider.
11 CODE OF CONDUCT
The policy implemented by DCAS incorporates HWC.
The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to
promote a high standard of professional ethics in the workplace.
HWC strives to adhere and comply
with the content of the Code.
Employees are made aware of the content of the Code of Conduct
through, among other things, the compulsory induction of all newly appointed employees. The Code
was distributed to all employees as a reminder to continue promoting high standards of professional
ethics in the workplace.
If and when the content of the code is breached, managers make use of
progressive discipline as necessary.
More serious offences are referred to the Corporate Services Centre
(Directorate Employee Relations) for formal disciplinary procedures.
12 HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
The policy as implemented by DCAS incorporates HWC.
Health and safety issues are addressed by
conducting monthly inspections at DCAS Head Office and annual audit inspections at all other offices
of the Department.
Contingency plans and business continuity plans have been compiled for all the
offices.
The managers at all offices have been appointed as health and safety risk coordinators, safety
marshals, first aiders and fire-fighters and trained.
Annual fire drills are conducted at offices in the Cape Town city centre in collaboration with the
Department of Community Safety and the Disaster Risk Management Department of the City of Cape
Town which monitor and provide comment in respect of all processes.
Occupational health and safety meetings are held quarterly at top management level to discuss
health, safety and environmental issues.
The holding of annual health and safety awareness programmes has considerably raised the level of
awareness in the entity.
The entity has implemented a waste management programme.
Waste paper is collected and disposed of every month.

PART E: FINANCIAL INFORMATION
REPORT OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL TO THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCIAL PARLIAMENT ON
THE HERITAGE WESTERN CAPE
REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Introduction
1.
I have audited the financial statements of the Heritage Western Cape set out on pages
42 to 59, which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 March 2014, the
statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net assets, the cash flow
statement and the statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year
then ended, as well as the notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting
policies and other explanatory information.
Accounting authoritys responsibility for the financial statements
2.
The accounting authority is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
financial statements in accordance with the South African Standards of Generally
Recognised Accounting Practice (SA Standards of GRAP), and the requirements of the
Public Finance Management Act of South Africa,1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999) (PFMA) and
regulation 3(2) of the Provincial Heritage Resources Authority Regulations, 2002
(Provincial Notice No. 336 of 2002) (regulations), and for such internal control as the
accounting authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor-generals responsibility
3.
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my
audit.
I conducted my audit in accordance with the Public Audit Act of South Africa,
2004 (Act No. 25 of 2004) (PAA), the general notice issued in terms thereof and
International Standards on Auditing.
Those standards require that I comply with ethical
requirements, and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
4.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the
auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements.
5.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for my audit opinion.
38
Opinion
6.
In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Heritage Western Cape as at 31 March 2014, and its financial
performance, and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with SA Standards
of GRAP and the requirements of the PFMA and the regulations.
Emphasis of matter
7.
I draw attention to the matter below.
My opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Significant uncertainty
8.
As disclosed in note 17 to the financial statements, the entity is a defendant in a legal
claim as a result of a decision taken to decline an application for the development of a
declared provincial heritage site.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
9.
In accordance with the PAA and the general notice issued in terms thereof, I report the
following findings on the reported performance information against predetermined
objectives for selected objectives presented in the annual performance report, non-
compliance with legislation as well as internal control.
The objective of my tests was to
identify reportable findings as described under each subheading but not to gather
evidence to express assurance on these matters.
Accordingly, I do not express an
opinion or conclusion on these matters.
Predetermined objectives
10.
I performed procedures to obtain evidence about the usefulness and reliability of the
reported performance information for the following selected objective presented in the
annual performance report of the public entity for the year ended 31 March 2014:
To establish and maintain an integrated heritage resources management system in
the Western Cape (on pages 16 to 17).
11.
I evaluated the reported performance information against the overall criteria of
usefulness and reliability.
12.
I evaluated the usefulness of the reported performance information to determine
whether it was presented in accordance with the National Treasurys annual reporting
principles and whether the reported performance was consistent with the planned
objectives.
I further performed tests to determine whether indicators and targets were
well defined, verifiable, specific, measurable, time bound and relevant, as required by
the National Treasurys Framework for managing programme performance information.
13.
I assessed the reliability of the reported performance information to determine whether it
was valid, accurate and complete.
14.
I did not raise any material findings on the usefulness and reliability of the reported
performance information for the selected objective.
Additional matter
15.

Refer to the annual performance report (on pages 16 to 17) for information on the
achievement of the planned targets for the year.
Compliance with legislation
17. I performed procedures to obtain evidence that the entity had complied with applicable
I did not identify any instances of material non-compliance with specific matters in key
legislation, as set out in the general notice issued in terms of the PAA.
Internal control

income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

of financial assets as reflected on the face of the statement of financial position or in the notes thereto:
Trade and other receivables
Cash and cash equivalents
Loans and receivables
Loans and Receivables
Loans and Receivables
Categorised in terms of GRAP 104
Trade and other receivables
Cash and cash equivalents
1.7.1.2
After initial recognition,
financial assets are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method less an allowance for
impairment.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months, which are classified as non-
current assets.
1.7.1.3
Inventory consists of badges used to identify heritage sites.
Inventory is distributed at no charge and is therefore
valued at the lower of cost and current replacement cost.
1.7.2
A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity.
The
financial liabilities of the entity are trade and other payables as reflected on the face of the statement of
financial position and the notes thereto.
There are two main categories of financial liabilities, the classification based on how they are measured.
Financial liabilities may be measured at:
Fair value through surplus or deficit; or
Amortised cost
Inventory
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities that are measured at fair value through surplus or deficit are stated at fair value, with any
resulted gain or loss recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Any other financial liability should be
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.

1.8 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The entity makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by
definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed
below.
1.8.1 Provision for impairment of receivables
An estimate for the impairment of receivables is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
The provision for impairment debt shall be calculated on trade receivables only.
The total impairment provision of the entity shall be calculated either by individual debtor or at least per risk
category.
1.8.2 Contingent Liabilities
An estimate for contingent liabilities is made when the entity has a present legal obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate
of the amount of the obligation can be made.
1.9
The entity is not entitled to register as a VAT vendor.
However, if any funding is received that entitles the entity for
possible exemption such application will be lodged. VAT & POSSIBLE EXEMPTIONS

Risk Management
, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The entity is not exposed to market risk, due to it being required to settle creditors within 30 days of receiving an
invoice as required by the treasury regulations and the PFMA.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
In terms of its
borrowing requirements, the entity ensures that adequate funds are available to meet its expected and
unexpected financial commitments.
All outstanding Accounts payable balances are due within 30 days of the
reporting date.
Sensitivity analysis
At 31 March 2014, if the interest rates on variable rate financial instruments had been 1% higher/lower with all
other variables held constant, post tax surplus for the year would have been R20, 814 higher/lower.
Interest rate risk
The entitys risk profile consists of fixed and floating rate loans and bank balances which exposes the entity to
fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk and can be summarised as follows:
Financial Assets
Trade and other receivables are at a fixed rate.
Management manages interest rate risk by negotiating
beneficial rates on floating rate loans and where possible using fixed rate loans.
Management also has a policy balancing the interest on asset loans with the interest payable on liabilities.

Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss
to the entity. The entity has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy parties.
Credit risk consists mainly of cash deposits, cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and trade debtors.
The entity only deposits cash with major banks with high quality credit standing and limits exposure to any one
counterparty. No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting year, and management does not expect any losses from
non-performance by these counterparties
Maximum exposure to credit risk
The entitys exposure to credit risk with regards to loans and receivables is limited to the amounts on the balance
sheet.

Health infrastructure delivery
The Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works delivers infrastructure and services
to people of the province to promote positive socio-economic outcome and safe, empowered and
connected communities.
The Western Capes first green clinic is expected to have been completed in Beaufort West in February 2017.
This R23,5 million facility was commissioned by the Department of
Transport and Public Works for the provincial Department of Health.
It will render the full range of primary health care services when it opens its doors to the public next year.
Beaufort West is usually dusty, very hot during the day, and very cold at night.
A conventional approach to regulating temperature and air circulation relies heavily on air conditioning.
The designers of this 1 050 m2 single-storey building have reduced the need for air conditioning through appropriate design and natural materials.
The building has thick rammed earth walls which heat up slowly during the day, and cool down slowly at night.
This serves to keep the building cool during the hottest time of the day,
and warm at night.
Ventilation chimneys draw in air high above the ground where it is less dusty and take it down through rock stores underneath the building which temper the air
before it goes to the air conditioning system.
The use of rammed earth and rocks reduces the need for heating and cooling, and both materials are harvested from nature rather than
having to be manufactured.
The design maximises the benefit of natural light by incorporating north-facing single-banked corridors with views of nature.
The roof overhangs are designed to minimise the amount
of summer sun coming into the building, while allowing in as much sun as possible in winter.
The corridors are wide enough to incorporate patient waiting areas and are located around
landscaped courtyards planted with indigenous saffron trees.
Other green design features include energy-efficient lighting and solar water heating.
The clinic will be fitted with an energy monitoring system so that its energy consumption can be compared with similar facilities built with more conventional methods and materials.
When it opens its doors to the public, the clinic will offer treatment for infectious and chronic diseases, oral health services, rehabilitation services, and specialised services for women
and children.
We lead in the delivery of government infrastructure and related services BEttEr tOGEtHEr.

FOREWORD BY THE MINISTER FOR
COMMUNITY SAFETY
WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE
Crime creates a web of fear and impacts on the daily lives of
many people in the Western Cape and South Africa as a
whole.
Increasing safety is imperative to improving the quality
of life of all South Africans.
The Constitution of South Africa stipulates that national policing policy may make provision for
differing policies in differing provinces after taking into account the policing needs and
priorities.
The Department of Community Safety consulted with communities across the
province during the 2010/11 financial year including members of all 149 Community Police
Forums as well as Business Against Crime in order to assess the policing needs and priorities in
each respective community.
The Policing Needs and Priorities (PNPs) Report, is a culmination of
this consultative process and provides an overview of the policing needs and priorities of the
Western Cape.
The report furthers the Provinces civilian oversight role and also aims to assist in
increasing safety and reducing the impact of crime in our communities, in line with the
Provincial Governments strategic objectives.
It is widely recognised that crime needs to be
addressed in a multifaceted approach and community involvement is an integral part of the
strategy to address crime.
The participation of communities, as the recipients of police service,
is therefore very
important. The Department of Community Safety will monitor the
implementation of the recommendations of this report to ensure that policing in the Western
Cape is indeed responsive to the needs of the community.
The PNPs Report is one of the
processes that assists the Department of Community Safety in exercising its constitutional
mandate to monitor police conduct.
The Department of Community Safety is legally
mandated to perform civilian oversight over police , and regards the PNP project as the
backbone of this process.
Key in reducing crime is the improvement of service delivery by
policing agencies.
The service delivery issues raised in this report cover a wide range of police
services, such as: police resource allocation, service delivery by the officers deployed at the
community services centres, detective services, police visibility, police accountability, the levels
of satisfaction regarding how law enforcement agencies deal with alcohol and drug related
crimes, and the witness protection programme.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the representatives of the Community Police
Forums who participated in the process and generously shared their ideas and sacrificed
their time. I thank the researchers in my Department and recognise their hard work and dedication.
I wish to thank General Lamoer for his continued cooperation as well as thank
the SAPS members who formed part of the PNPs steering committee for the support they
offered.
The varied contributions of all the collaborators of this report are greatly
appreciated.
I trust that the findings of this report will contribute to increasing safety in the
Western Cape Province.

REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLICING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE (2010/11)
FOREWORD BY THE
HEAD OF DEPARTMENT:
DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SAFETY
This is the second year which the Department of Community
Safety has compiled a report on the Policing Needs and Priorities
(PNPs) as identified by the Community Police Forums and
related studies1.
This report forms an integral part of the execution of the Departments legislative mandate to exercise
civilian oversight over law enforcement agencies and to improve community police
relations.
This report serves to assist law enforcement agencies to be more responsive to
the policing needs and priorities of communities, to grow the trust of communities in
policing services and to encourage more people and institutions to become involved in
making their respective communities safer.
The levels of crime (especially contact and drug-related crimes) remain unacceptably
high in the province.
The nature of these crimes indicates that SAPS or any other
government department or civil society organisation on its own will not be able to address
the challenge of crime.
Government (national, provincial and local spheres) and civil
society need to synergise their strategies and resources.
The report is therefore developed in such a way that SAPS (national, provincial, cluster and
and District Municipalities can benefit from the findings of the report
and develop more relevant and appropriate responses. The report will be made available
to a wide as possible audience to promote collective ownership and responsibility for the
creation of safer environments.
My wish is that this report will challenge government departments, civil society organizations
and ordinary citizens to become more aware of our respective roles in creating a safer society.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
2.1 INTRODUCTION
Section 206(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996,
stipulates that the Cabinet Minister responsible for policing should determine national
policing policy, after consulting with the provincial governments and taking into account
the policing needs and priorities of the provinces as identified by the provincial executives.
In support of the provincial executive of the Western Cape, the Department of Community
Safety embarked on a process of identifying the Policing Needs and Priorities (PNPs) of the
communities in the Western Cape Province.
The MEC will present the results to the South
African Police Service (SAPS) Provincial Commissioner to consider incorporating the findings into
the provincial annual performance and local station plans of the police for the 2011/12
financial year.
The aim is to influence the SAPS operational priorities to be more responsive to
the community needs.
Therefore the main focus of this report is the policing needs and priorities
as identified by the communities in terms of crime, aspects of service delivery and substance
abuse.
Finally the report focuses on whether the Community Police Forums (CPFs) provide input
into the SAPS station and resource utilization plans.
The report can be applied in three ways:
Firstly, it is intended to inform the MEC for Community Safety in the Western Cape about
the PNPs as identified by the communities of the Western Cape.
Secondly, the identified
provincial PNPs will guide the formulation of policing policy at national level in respect of
provincial policing needs and priorities.
Thirdly, the recommendations included in the PNPS
report will aid CPFs in exercising their civilian oversight role.
The CPFs will be in a position to
monitor the implementation of identified PNPs at local police station level.
The CPF executive members at the 149 full-fledged police stations in the Western Cape serve
as the unit of analysis.
A hundred percent response rate was achieved.
In total 1, 340
questionnaires were completed.
Data was gathered through focus groups that were guided
by a self-completion questionnaire.
Qualitative data gathered in this manner was then
triangulated with secondary data that includes the Community Safety Barometer project

The communities of the Western Cape Province have identified five priority crimes that
they are most concerned about in their respective areas.
These are Assault GBH, sexual
offences, common assault, common robbery and domestic violence.
In addition to the
priority crimes identified, the communities concerned most frequently mentioned burglary
at residential premises more often than any other crime category, even though it does not
form part of the top priority crimes.

REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLICING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE (2010/11)
12
During the 2009/10 PNPs2 study, communities identified assault GBH, burglary at residential
premises drug related crimes, murder and common robbery.
The addition of sexual offences
and domestic violence may indicate an increase of awareness of these two crime categories.
It should be noted that both sexual offences and domestic violence formed part of the
frequently mentioned crime categories.
Both sexual offences and domestic violence form part
of the frequently mentioned crime categories during the 2009/2010 PNPS study.
The district municipalities follow the same pattern in terms of crime categories except the
Cape Winelands district municipality that also identified murder as a top priority crime.
Drugs and gangs are not identified as top priority crimes, but were identified as priorities
during the MEC outreach programmes and the Safety Barometer Study (2009/2010). The
Department of Community Safety Journal (1/ 2003) suggests that there is a close
relationship between drugs and gang.
2.2.2 SERVICE DELIVERY ISSUES
The service delivery issues include the suitability of resources in addressing crime, resource
utilization, services rendered at the Community Service Centre (CSC), services rendered by
the detectives, witness protection programme, police visibility and response time as well as
the input which CPFs provide to the resource utilization and station plans of the police.
The majority of the participants of the Western Cape are of the view that the police resources
are not suitable in addressing crime in their respective communities.
The general perception is
that most police stations are experiencing staff and vehicle shortages that result in a slow
response time to crime situations.
The CSCs in some stations are reportedly very small and do
not allow privacy to victims of trauma.
In the rural areas the long distance between the
communities and police stations was identified as a major challenge.
In relation to utilization of resources more than half of the participants indicated that the police
officers utilise the resources effectively.
The key challenge is the limited resources, which cannot
address the needs of the communities.
However it should be noted that participants
highlighted the misuse of limited resources by police officers for their personal gain.
The majority of participants are of the view that the police officers deployed at the Community
Service Centres are sufficient and at the same time polite and helpful to community members.
A serious challenge identified at the CSC is the language barrier where the deployed officers
at the CSCs cannot communicate with complainants in their preferred language.
More than half of the participants indicated their satisfaction with the services offered by
detectives.
In general the participants are of the view that with the limited resources
detectives are doing their level best.
Some of the challenges identified by the participants
are the shortage of skilled detectives that result in poor investigations; lack of feedback
provided to complainants and long time frames to complete investigations.
2 Department of Community Safety, Report on the identification of Policing Needs and Priorities (PNPs) in the Western Cape Province,
2010/11 unpublished.
13
In relation to the witness protection programme the majority of communities indicated
that they do not know whether witnesses of crime are protected.
The participants do not
seem to be aware of the programme or think that the programme is not effective.
To improve police visibility in the areas the majority of participants proposed that more
police patrols during the day and night should be conducted.
However, it should be
noted that most participants are of the view that foot patrols and stop and search
operations would be more effective.
The full implementation of sector policing in the
communities is identified as a strategy for more effective policing.
The majority of participants agree that the police should respond to a crime situation
between 5 to 10 minutes, as this will increase the chances of gathering evidence.
This is
lower than the SAPS service standard response time of between 15 and 20 minutes.
Regarding CPFs providing input into SAPS station plans and the allocation of resources,
participants do not know if CPFs give input into the station plan or the way that they
impact on how resources are allocated at their respective police stations.
2.2.3 SUBSTANCE ABUSE
A theme on substance abuse was added to the questionnaire because both national and
provincial governments have identified substance abuse as a priority.
Furthermore the
Western Cape accounts for nearly 50% of the national reported cases on drug related
crimes during the 2009/2010 financial year.
Lastly, substance abuse is regarded as one of
the major contributors to crime
The majority of communities acknowledged that substance abuse is a challenge in their
areas.
The majority of the participants are not satisfied with the way police address the
problem of substance abuse.
There is a perception that the shebeen owners and drug
lords are bribing police officers.
2.3 CONCLUSION
The SAPS operational priorities are in line with the identified PNPs of the communities.
The
SAPS operational categories are too broad and do not specify which specific types of
crime will be prioritized.
Addressing the specific crimes is regarded as the responsibility of
local police stations.
The level of satisfaction with police service differs between police stations and therefore need
to be addressed at local station level.
The services rendered in the CSC are generally regarded
as satisfactorily.
A major concern in the province is the lack of trust in the witness protection
programme and the ability of the SAPS to deal with illegal drug and liquor traders.
The fact that crime priorities and the level of satisfaction with services differ between
stations places additional responsibility on CPFs to exercise their civilian oversight role at
local station level.
This study however indicates that the majority of CPFs do not provide
input into the station and resource deployment plans of the police.
14
2.4 RECOMMENDATIONS
I)
That the findings of this report be incorporated in the Provincial and local SAPS
annual plans for the 2011/12 financial year.
II)
III)
That Community Police Forums be assisted to develop indicators to monitor
police performance at local police precinct level.
That SAPS develop a strategy to address the problem of weapons and sharp objects
since these have been utilized in committing priority offences such as assault GBH.
IV) Promoting and raising awareness within communities about the Witness Protection
Programmes to encourage community members to testify in the prosecution of criminals.
V)
The training and development of skills of detectives need to continue, especially in
respect of investigating crimes such as domestic violence and sexual offences.
VI) Enhance skills of detectives for improved evidence collection and recording and the
processing of evidence in order to build strong and prosecutable cases.
This will increase
the number of cases brought before court and the conviction rate in respect thereof.
VII) That sector policing be adequately resourced and promoted and receives the
necessary support in order to improve response times and to promote police visibility.
VIII) That Station Commanders be sensitised in respect of the need for CPFs to be engaged
for input into the station and resource utilization plans of respective police stations.
IX) An illegal drug supply reduction strategy should be developed and implemented by
SAPS with the assistance of other partners.
The role of organized crime syndicates and gangs as drivers of crime, more especially
crime involving drug abuse and violence within the Western Cape Province, cannot
be underestimated.
Accordingly it is necessary for all policing agencies to focus on
how best to neutralize and or mitigate the impact of organised crime and gangs.

3.1 INTRODUCTION AND METHODOLOGY
The South African Police Service (SAPS) has a constitutional mandate with regard to the
safety of communities.
This includes combating, preventing and investigating crime.
Based
on this mandate the public have certain expectations from the SAPS and other law
enforcement agencies.
These expectations of the communities in terms of policing are
defined as Policing Needs and Priorities.
This report reflects the findings of focus group
discussions conducted mainly with the Community Police Forum (CPF) structures within the
jurisdiction of the 149 fully-fledged police stations in the Western Cape Province, in order to
identify the Policing Needs and Priorities (PNPs) of the communities. In addition to provide
information on the legislative mandate guiding the PNPs, the report will sketch the
background to the assessment, explain its scope  inclusive of the methodological
approach  and present its findings.
Finally, following on some concluding remarks, the
report will offer certain recommendations.
The Department is inter alia responsible for analysing crime trends and patterns identified
by the communities and for improving community/ police relations.
As part of this process the Department of Community Safety will conduct a study on the PNPs of the various
communities and compile a consolidated report.
Once the consolidated report has been finalised and endorsed by the Minister of
Community Safety,
it will be submitted to the SAPS Provincial Commissioner for
incorporation in the SAPS Annual Performance Plan for the 2011/12 financial year. The
implementation of the findings of the PNPs report will be monitored by the Department to
ensure that SAPS operations are responsive to the community policing needs.
Overall, the
PNPs will assist the SAPS to redirect policing in the Western Cape, and to improve the
civilian oversight role of the Department and the communities over the police.
3.2 LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK
that the Cabinet Minister responsible for policing should determine national policing policy
after consulting the provincial governments, and taking into account the policing needs and
priorities of the provinces as identified by the provincial executives.
This report will inform the
provincial executive on the policing needs and priorities in the Western Cape.
Furthermore, the White Paper on Transforming Service Delivery (Batho Pele White Paper3)
indicates that citizens should be consulted about the level and quality of the public
services they receive, and wherever possible should be given a choice as to the services
being offered.
In keeping with this Batho Pele principle, communities were consulted to
determine their PNPs.
Thus it is anticipated that this report on the PNPs will assist the SAPS to be more responsive
to the policing needs of the communities.
3 White Paper on Transforming Service Delivery: Department of Public Service and Administration, 1997
INTRODUCTION AND METHODOLOGY
Similarly, Section 10.1.4 of the Community Police Forum Uniform Constitution: Western
Cape, states that at an annual general meeting,  the forum shall receive, discuss and
adopt the Community Safety Plan.
"The Community Safety Plan will be informed by the
PNPs as perceived by the people.
To this end, this report is presented in such a way that it
reflects the PNPs per police station, which ought to facilitate the incorporation of its
findings into the Community Safety Plans.
In addition, the Department of Community Safety's Secretariat for Safety and Security -
Civilian Oversight: Accountability Framework identified the PNPs as one area that needs to
be researched in order to strengthen the Department's civilian oversight role of the police.
The identified PNPs will be used as a tool to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of
policing in the Western Cape4.
Finally, the identification of the PNPs are mandated by Section 18.1(c) of the South African
Police Service Act, No. 68 of 1995, which specifies that one of the objectives of a Community
Police Forum (CPF) is to promote co-operation between the service and the community in
fulfilling the needs of the community regarding policing.
Thus, the police should ensure that
the services rendered are transparent and in line with the identified PNPs.
3.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE PNPs REPORT
The key objectives of the report are:
to inform the Minister of Community Safety with regard to the PNPs in
the Western Cape Province;
to guide the formulation of policing policy at national and provincial level, and
to assist the CPFs in exercising their civilian oversight role by identifying the PNPs in
their respective areas.
The policing needs are, however, based on the socio-political context of the community.
The main focus of this report will be crime, service delivery issues and CPFs input into the
police station plans.
The police are responsible for providing services to diverse socio-
economic groups of communities.
The more affluent groups are able to provide private security while the poor communities
are at the mercy of criminals.
Some areas are densely populated with limited resources
and infrastructure while other areas are sparsely populated.
Overall the intended outcome of the identification of PNPs is to promote democratic
accountability, service delivery and civilian oversight of the police in the province.

3.4 METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
The nature of the Policing Needs and Priorities study necessitated a mixed method
approach, where quantitative and qualitative research designs are used to complement
each other. The combination of quantitative and qualitative research design provides an
insight that would not be obtained had only one of these designs been used.
The
purposeful sampling was used in the study targeting the CPF members for each of the 149
fully-fledged police stations in the Province.
The CPF was used as unit of analysis in the study for three reasons. Firstly, they represent
different community structures beyond the policing function.
Secondly, the scope of the
project and time frame necessitated that the CPF be used as manageable group of
participants to solicit data about the policing needs and priorities of the different
community. Thirdly, the CPFs are regarded as the elected members of the community to
liaise with SAPS on the policing needs and priorities of a community5.
A self-completion questionnaire6 was used to collect the data.
In total 1340 questionnaires
were completed.
The CPF members were organised and visited at their preferred location
in the community, mostly in the evenings.
The purpose of the study was thoroughly
explained to them by officials.
The engagement took the form of focus group discussions.
The questionnaire data was captured and analysed using an analytical software package
i.e. Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 18 (SPSS).
Descriptive statistical analysis
(frequencies, cross tabulation) was done using the SPPS statistical base software.
The open-
ended questions were analysed using the SPSS text analytics.
The analytical process draws a
different variables used in the study was done at the level of the province, district municipality
and police cluster levels to determine trends and patterns of responses.
These results were
compared with the official SAPS provincial reported crime statistics for the period 2009/2010.
The results were presented in the form of graphs and tables.
Since the PNPs project is done for the second time in the province, attempts were made to do a
comparative analysis of some variables.
Furthermore, the, results of the study were synthesized and
triangulated with available literature on studies like the Victim Survey (2007), Community Safety
Barometer study conducted by the Department of Community Safety (2009/10), SAPS annual report
2009/10 and the SAPS Western Cape Performance Plan (2010/2011) and more importantly, the
reports on MEC outreach (izimbizo) programme were used.

INTRODUCTION AND METHODOLOGY
4.1 PRESENTATION OF DATA
The data has been presented by means of the different variables included in the
questionnaire.
These variables included the identified priority crimes, service delivery issues,
CPFs input into the police station plans, substance abuse and other comments made with
regard to policing.
The data was presented with the aid of graphs and tables in order to
enable the reader to understand the general trends of the PNPs within the Province, the
respective district municipalities, the police clusters and police stations.
The section to
follow provides an overview of the province in general, encompassing an overview of the
district municipalities, police clusters, police stations, key findings and recommendations.
4.2 OVERVIEW OF THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE
According to the StatsSA 2007 community-based survey, the Western Cape Province has an
estimated population of 5.30 million people7 of which approximately 64% live in the Cape Town
metropolitan municipality. The Western Cape has one metropolitan municipality (the City of
Cape Town) and five district municipalities (Cape Winelands, Central Karoo, Eden, Overberg
and West Coast).
The one metropolitan municipality and the five district municipalities
encompass 24 local municipalities (see Annexure B).
According to Statistics SA, Census 2001,
the Western Cape is the second most affluent province in South Africa where an estimated
1.8 million persons are deemed to be vulnerable.
The Western Cape Province has 149 police precincts (see Annexure B), which can be
classified as either urban8 (59) or rural9 (90).
The police stations are further grouped into 25
police clusters, which are regarded as an extension of the Provincial Office10.
4.3 OVERVIEW OF CRIME IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE
Overall, contact crime decreased by 6% in the Province just below the national target of
decreasing contact crime by 7-10%, murder (3.1%), attempted murder (3.3%) and robbery with
aggravating circumstances (1.3%).
The highest incidence of all reported sexual offences
(180.7%) was recorded in the Western Cape11.
The Western Cape has recorded the second
highest incidence of common assault following the Free State province in the Country.
The Western Cape Province continues to be the province mostly affected by drugs.
Provincial
crime statistics show that the Western Cape recorded 60,409 drug-related crimes between April
2009 and March 2010.
The province has experienced a 14% increase in drug-related crimes
compared to the previous period of April 2008-March 2009.
This more than tripled the figures
recorded for period April 2003-March 2004.
When comparing the Western Capes

11 South African Police Service, Annual report 2009/10
current figures with the rest of the country, we see that nearly half of the countrys drug-
related crimes were recorded in the province.
Poverty, unemployment, proliferations of shebeens, high school dropouts, the high influx of
people into the province, shortage of community cohesion, environmental circumstances
and densely populated settlements all contribute to crime in the province.
These factors
are in the main concentrated in the disadvantaged communities and combined they
make residents more susceptible to crime12.
A study13 done by the Department of Community Safety on xenophobic violence during the
FIFA Soccer World Cup 2010, identified xenophobic related violence in at least 12 areas.
These areas are Ceres, De Doorns, Genadendal, Houtbay, Milnerton/Du Noon, Khayelitsha, Knysna,
Kraaifontein, Nyanga (Samora Machel, Browns Farm), Ocean View (Masiphumelele),
Mbekweni and Wellington14. Furthermore, the influx of foreign nationals is blamed for the misery
in the townships in the province.
The perception among South African citizens in the poverty
stricken areas is that they are competing for scarce resources with the foreign nationals.
4.3.1 SAPS PROVINCIAL OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES
The South African Police Service strategic priorities in the Western Cape for 2010/11 include
amongst other things crime prevention of all crimes, crime perception management,
combating corruption, implementation of sector policing,
organised crime and enabling the investigative work of the detective service.
investigating of crime,
The Western Cape provincial operational priorities did not specify which specific types of
crime in the categories contact crime will be prioritized.
It should be noted that the SAPS
operational crime priorities are broad, making comparisons difficult.
4.3.2 IDENTIFIED POLICING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF THE COMMUNITIES
4.3.2.1 IDENTIFIED CATEGORIES OF TOP PRIORITY CRIME IN THE PROVINCE
Graph 1 reflects the frequency of the top priority crimes that were identified by the
communities under priority crime one.
According to the identified PNPs of the communities
the province is mainly faced with contact crime.
A contact or violent crime poses a more
harmful threat to South Africa than crime in general.
This type of crime will always have a
more serious psychological impact than other types of crime15.

GRAPH 1: TOP FIVE PRIORITY CRIMES IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE (COMMUNITY IDENTIFIED PNPs)
107
227
The top five crimes in the province as identified by the communities of the Western Cape include
assault GBH, sexual offences, common assault, common robbery and domestic violence.
In comparison to the previous financial year 2009/10 assault GBH and common robbery seem
to remain in the list of top priority crimes in the province.
Sexual offences, common assault and
domestic violence have replaced burglary at residential premises, drug related crimes and
murder which were identified as top priority crimes in the previous financial year (2009/10).
I) ASSAULT GBH
According to the identified PNPs of the communities the province is mainly faced with
contact crime16, with assault GBH identified as the top-priority crime in this instance.
The
major factors contributing to assault GBH are alcohol, drug abuse and domestic violence.
Most perpetrators of assault GBH are men and partners of the victims, with alcohol and
drug abuse contributing to these crimes.
According to the SAPS Annual Report for 2009/10,
most assault GBH involves victims and perpetrators who know one another (whether as
family members, friends, acquaintances or colleagues).
Assault GBH mostly takes place at homes, clubs, taverns, places of employment and other
places of social gatherings.
Assault GBH commonly causes serious physical, psychological
and material damage to victims, leaving lasting scars on the psyche of the South African
society and on the country's economic well-being.
This necessitates that the community
members should change their way of living.
A recent study on violence17, revealed that most of the assaults and murders are
committed using knives or sharp objects.
Government needs to come up with a strategy
to deal with weapons and sharp objects that are being used in such crimes.
16 Contact crime is a crime against a person and it involves physical contact between the perpetrators and victims.
The Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR), Tackling Armed Violence, March 2010.
24
II) SEXUAL OFFENCES
According to the identified PNPs of the communities, sexual offences also give cause for
concern.
Sexual offence statistics often present a contested terrain because of the nature
of such offences.
People are reluctant to report these crimes, which result in the under-
reporting of cases of sexual offence18.
Alcohol and drug abuse are associated with sexual
offences.
People under the influence of alcohol and drugs are regarded as promiscuous
and vulnerable to being sexually abused.
The perpetrators of sexual offences are mainly
the partner, lover or spouse of the victim or, in some cases, close relatives.
People
affected by sexual offences are mostly women and children.
It is important to educate the
community on responsible use of alcohol and to intensify the fight against drug abuse.
There is a need to create an environment in which victims of sexual offences feel safe.
III) COMMON ASSAULT
According to the SAPS crime statistics in the province common assault has increased by
8.6%.
Common assault is a social experience that occurs between people who know
each other in the privacy of their own homes.
This type of crime cannot be covered by
conventional policing which put responsibility to the community members to change their
lifestyles to prevent them being victims of crime19.
IV) COMMON ROBBERY
According to the reported crime statistics 2009/10 common robbery has increased in the
province by 12.3%.
According to the identified PNPs of the communities, common robbery
also remains a challenge in the province.
Substance abuse, mainly alcohol abuse, has
consistently been identified to be at the forefront of causing crime, particularly violent
crime in the province.
The 2009/2010 crime statistics confirmed that nearly half (45%) of the
drug related crimes in the country were recorded in the Western Cape.
Drug related crime
increased by 14.5% compared to the 2008/2009 figures.
Shockingly, these 2009/2010
figures marks 200% from the 2003/2004 figures of drug related crime.
In addition, the
province is characterised by early darkness in winter, which makes commuters susceptible
to common robbery to and from work.
V) DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
The communities identified domestic violence to be a matter of concern in the province.
All
too often, individuals co-habiting in domestic relationships daily endure perpetual abuse on
some or other level.
It should be noted that the SAPS does not list domestic violence as one of
their crime categories.
Incidents of domestic violence are recorded in a separate domestic
violence register.
The reporting of domestic violence in the province has increased.20
The police do not have a separate crime category for domestic violence and it is important to
create this category to improve the reporting on domestic violence to the public.
To address
the domestic violence problem, social interventions need to be initiated vigorously.

VI) TOP PRIORITY CRIMES IDENTIFIED BY THE BUSINESS FRATERNITY (BACWC)
According to the BACWC the five priority crimes are armed robbery (robbery at non-
, burglary at business premises, fraud (commercial crimes), hijacking
and theft of motor vehicles.
There are no similarities that exist between the
identified top priority crimes by the business fraternity and community-based structures
(CPFs).
The business fraternity is mostly concerned about property-related crimes and
aggravated robberies.
In 2007/8 robbery at non-residential (armed robbery) premises increased by 166% from 635
cases to 1,058 cases reported in 2008/09.
In 2009/10 the reported cases of robbery at non-
residential premises stabilised with 1,058 cases reported in 2009/10 which is the same number of
cases reported in the previous year (2008/9).
Burglary at business premises has increased in the
province by 10.5% according to the reported crime statistics 2009/10. In 2009/10 commercial
crimes increased by 2.9% compared to 2008/9.
According to reported crime statistics 2009/10
theft of motor vehicles and truck hijacking have decreased in the province by 7.2% and 52%
respectively.
Although these crimes decreased the perception of BACWC is still of the opinion
that these crime categories need to be prioritized.
4.3.2.2 FREQUENTLY MENTIONED PRIORITY CRIMES
According to the identified PNPs of the community, the five most frequently mentioned
categories of priority crime were burglary at residential premises, domestic violence, assault
GBH, sexual offences21 and common assault.
Almost all the identified priority crimes were
mentioned frequently in the previous financial year 2009/10 by the communities with the
exception of common assault which replaces drug related crimes.
Substance abuse will
be discussed in a separate section.

BURGLARY AT RESIDENTIAL PREMISES
21 Domestic violence includes sexual abuse, physical abuse or assault, damage to property, stalking, emotional abuse and any other controlling or
abusive behaviour which poses a threat to a person's safety, health or well-being.
26
I) BURGLARY AT RESIDENTIAL PREMISES
Burglary at residential premises has been identified as one of the frequently mentioned crimes
in the province.
According to the 2009/10 crime statistics for the province, burglary at
residential premises increased by 0.9%.
Although the increase in reported cases of burglaries is
small the psychological effects on the victims are more serious.
In the previous financial year
2009/10 communities identified unemployment and poverty, drug abuse and shortage of
police visibility to be major contributors of crime in the province.
Different schools of thought
exist regarding the influence of socio-economic status on crime.
Some are of the view that no
link exists between unemployment and crime as most unemployed people living in poverty do
not commit crime.
It is indicated that the causes of crime lie within the mind of a person22.
Added to a criminal mind these factors create an opportunity to commit a crime.
II) GANGSTERISM
Most gangs in the Cape Flats are involved in drug trafficking to some extent.
Gang
trafficking ranges from street level sales to whole sale distribution.
(Monitor page 29) The
general perception is that Gangs and Drugs are closely associated.
The majority of
participants identified drugs as a problem, but in general participants did not identify
gangs as a crime problem.
During the MEC for Community Safetys outreach programmes
the theme of gangsterism can be clearly identified in the questions raised by community
members.
Gangsterism normally draws attention when somebody gets killed in a particular
area.
Gang violence is linked to drug markets.
When no act of violence is committed,
gang activities like trading with drugs goes relatively unchecked.
The absence of gang
related violence does not mean that no gang activities are present in these communities.
The use of illegal drugs in the community may indicate the presence of gang activity.
During the PNPs (2009/10) gangsterism was also not identified as a crime, but as one of the
causes of crime.
The inability of communities to identify gangsterism as a criminal act
may clearly indicate a lack of understanding or knowledge of the Prevention of
Organised Crime Act which criminalize people who organise and promote gang activity.
This act is generally regarded as being utilized to curb gang activity.

4.3.2.3 SERVICE DELIVERY ISSUES
Contact of communities with SAPS is mostly through the CSC, when the communities need
the services of SAPS and when they are in need of protection.
For those community
members who report a crime or who are witnesses in a criminal case, the witness
protection programme is vital.
The level of satisfaction of the community with these
services is crucial to effective policing.
These services however are influenced by the
allocation and utilization of resources by SAPS.
The graph below illustrates the levels of all
the above-mentioned service delivery related categories.

I) SUITABILITY OF RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING CRIME IN COMMUNITIES
Seventy percent (70%) of participants are of the view that the police are inadequately
equipped to manage crime in their area and 30 % identified that the resources are not suitable
in addressing crimes in their respective communities.
The most identified resource challenges
include the shortage of police vehicles and police officers, shortage of police visibility, the size
of the police station and sectors and slow response times to attend to complaints.
Thirty
percent (30%) of participants are of the view that the police are doing their best considering
the limited resources.
The communities recommend that more police officers and vehicles
should be allocated to their respective police stations to improve service delivery.
REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLICING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE (2010/11)
28
II) UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES
Fifty five percent (55%) of the participants are of the view that the police officers utilise
resources effectively, whereas 45% are of the view that the police do not.
Most community
members are of the opinion that the police officers misuse the police vehicles for their
personal benefit and as a result most of the time the vehicles are not operational.
When
the community call for assistance they are told that the vehicles are not available.
When asked, What can be done to improve resource allocation and utilization in the
respective areas, 68% of community members indicated that more dedicated police
officers should be employed, 57% are of the view that the number of police vehicles
should be increased, and 50% are of the view that more police officers should be
deployed at the CSC.
Some other suggestions offered were instituting dog unit patrols;
encouraging the development of local language skills that better reflect the community in
which the officers work, and training the officers how to respectfully engage with
community members in their home language.
In relation to service delivery issues the BACWC indicated that the resources allocated to
the SAPS are not suitable in addressing crime that affects businesses.
The overall human
resources are not efficient to execute proper sector policing.
The resources are reported
not to be accessible to the business community at the police stations except by means of
Crime Forums or Community Police Forums.
In terms of the utilization of resources the
business sector is of the opinion that the resources are not utilized effectively.
Too many
police vehicles are seen driving to and from their homes with family and friends as
passengers.
The response times to complaints in certain instances are unacceptable.
III) COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTRE (CSC)
To the question, Are there enough police officials assisting people in the Community
Service Centre, 58% of participants are of the opinion that there are enough police
officials assisting people at the CSC while 42% are of the view that there are not enough.
(A) POLICE CONDUCT AT THE CSC
Seventy four percent (74%) of participants agree that in spite of a shortage of resources
and personnel, those police officials who operate in the CSCs are polite and helpful while
26% do not agree.
This is an important statistic when one considers the institutional importance of soft skills in
the pursuit of effective service delivery23.
When a community member is treated with
dignity they are more likely to form a trusting partnership with the local police service.

PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS
29
The communities proposed that bigger and more user-friendly police stations should be
built to give privacy to trauma victims.
Also, to deploy more trained and dedicated police
officers at the CSC on duty that can address the complainants in their home language
thus training of police officers at the CSC on communication skills are recommended.
IV) SERVICES RENDERED BY THE DETECTIVES
It is difficult to give an accurate reflection of satisfaction with services rendered in situations
where the outcome of investigations may influence the community members perception of
effectiveness.
Nonetheless, the graph shows that 56% of the community members are satisfied
with the services rendered by the detectives in their area with 44% responding negatively.
Some of the challenges identified by the communities include the shortage of investigators,
shortage of feedback given by the detectives to the complainants, no proper investigation of
cases, shortage of expertise and long time frames spent on investigating and finalising cases.
When asked What can be done to improve the services offered by the detectives in your
area, 61% of community members agreed that there is a need to recruit more skilled
detectives, while 55% are of the view that detectives should be trained, 47% feel that more
resources should be provided and 39% are of the opinion that the workload of detectives
should be reduced.
The detectives need to have more access to transportation,
communication devices, and a central location to meet community needs.
The business fraternity BACWC indicated that the services rendered by detectives is not
satisfactory as their level of experience is very low.
In improving the services more skilled
detectives should be recruited, more training should be provided - reducing their
workload, and providing the detectives with more resources and reinstatement of the
uniform enquiry branch to handle less serious cases.
V) WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAMME
Graph 3 reflects the breakdown in communication with police sponsored witness
protection.
Forty nine percent (49%) of the participants do not know if the witnesses of
crime are protected, while 29% is of the opinion that they are protected and 22% are of
the view that the witnesses are not protected.
The witness protection programme provides space for the police officials to pursue a more
holistic method of dealing with crime and criminality in communities.
With the shortage of
witness- protection programmes, successful prosecution is not possible.
30
In an open-ended response format participants identified education, anti-corruption measures,
and increased witness protection as the three major themes for improving the witness
protection programme.
The majority of people who answered this optional question focussed
on what was revealed in the previous questions in that there was simply a shortage of
knowledge about the programme.
The other themes deal with the untrustworthiness of the
police regarding the protection of witnesses in the eyes of the community.

When asked to consider what would help to improve police visibility in the community,
participants mostly favoured options that involved increased physical presence of police
officers carrying out activities like stop and search operations.
Sixty eight percent (68%) of
participants are of the view that the police should patrol their specific areas day and
night, 56% are of the view that more stop and search operations should be conducted in
the province.
Fifty percent (50%) of the participants also are of the view that the full implementation of
sector policing should be conducted.
Police patrols should be conducted in the business sector several times a day.
More police patrols during the day and night, more stop and
search operations should also be conducted.
Integrated response with Metro Police/ Traffic Department/ Law enforcement of
municipalities and the private security companies should be conducted.
Reinstatement of
the flying squad, to attend to serious complaints, should be fast tracked.
24 Some of the participants selected more than one service delivery category which means that the total of percentages will not add up to 100%.

As reflected in most of the other responses, community members have a desire for the
police service to engage with the community in a professional way that is characterized
by swift communication.
The expected time for the police to respond to emergency
situations is 5 to 10 minutes.
Seventy four percent (74%) of participants are adamant that
police should respond to an emergency call within 5-10 minutes to increase chances of
gathering evidence as well as securing the crime scene.
However, it should be noted that
the SAPS standard reaction time to crime situations is 15 minutes25.
To a response regarding what can be done to improve the police response time to calls
for assistance, 57% of Community Police Forums chose for an increase in the numbers of
police vehicles and 76% of Community Police Forums chose for an increase in police
visibility and patrols.
The participants (Community Police Forums) are also of the view that
there should be an increase in SAPS personnel-, more effective Community Service
Centres- and encouraging neighbourhood watch programmes.
VIII) CPFs INPUT INTO THE POLICE STATION PLANS
The establishment of CPFs was to improve community police relations and make police
more responsive to the needs of the communities.
To achieve this, CPFs need to provide
input to the police plan and resource allocation of SAPS.
To assess the community police
relations the participants were asked to indicate if the CPFs give input into the station
plans on how the resources are allocated by the police.

Do the CPFs give input in the way resources
are allocated by police
There is an indication that communication, education and transparency are areas that
need immediate attention.
Forty two percent (42%) of participants were unaware of the
fact that the CPFs can give input into the station plan of the area.
Although it is
encouraging that 42 % of the participants reacted positively to the question, Does the
CPF give input in the way resources are allocated by the police in their area, it is worrying
that almost the same percentage has no idea that this dialogue takes place or whether it
has any impact on the outcome of decisions.
Nearly the same percentage of participants
stated that they provide input to the station plan and resource allocation.
It seems that
the practice of providing input is dependent on the local station preference. CPF
members and Station Commanders need to be sensitised on this matter.
According to BACWC the police do not provide reports on how resources are utilized nor
affords them to give input into the police station plan or the way resources are allocated
as they are not mandated to do so.
However, the police provide information about crime
and policing issues at the business sector meetings.
To improve police accountability, the
organisation suggests that the CPF should play more of a civilian oversight role in terms of
budget and crime on police station level.
The organisation is not part of the Provincial
Community Police Board and does not attend their meetings.
It was recommended that
the strategic alliance between BACWC and SAPS needs to be enhanced.
4.3.2.4 SUBSTANCE ABUSE
According to the reported crime statistics for the 2009/10 financial year nearly half of the
reported crime statistics for Drug related crimes were reported in the Western Cape.
On
closer investigation the number of people who requested assistance at rehabilitation centres
have doubled.
This coupled with the fact the National and Western Cape government
prioritized the fight against substance abuse, and that drug and alcohol abuse are regarded
as two of the main facilitators of crime, the report attempts to contribute to the body of
knowledge to understand the phenomena better in terms of policing needs and priorities.
Eighty eight percent (88%) of the community members recognize that the emerging
national problem of substance abuse is pervasive in their own communities.
A recognition
that substance abuse is a problem can lead to a better understanding of it's impact on
criminality in the community and may lead to a more vigilant community that is more
prone to identifying areas that encourage substance abuse and report on it.
GRAPH 5: SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM IN THE PROVINCE
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM

88% According to crime statistics, crime dependent on police action for detection, increased
by 15.3% from 67 836 in 2008/2009 to 78 234 in 2009/2010, where the bulk of it is drug
related crime.
Similarly, contact crime in the province increased by 6% from 88 818 in
2008/2009 to 94 146 in 2009/2010).
In the Western Cape, the increase in drug-related crime mirrors the substance abuse
challenge.
The Western Cape accounts for approximately, 45% of national drug related
crime and that is course for concern.
A number of research studies confirmed the nexus
between crime and substance abuse; hence, the increase in assault GBH, robberies, and
sex crimes is likely to be the result of substance abuse26.
As a result, there is a need for the
SAPS to develop a comprehensive drug supply reduction strategy, which should be
monitored on a quarterly basis.
Those who answered the question above were then asked whether or not they were satisfied with
the police's handling of illegal shebeens and drug outlets.
Of the 88% of the population who
recognised substance abuse as a community problem less than half (44%) were satisfied with police
actions aimed at curbing the problem.
This reflects a majority are of the opinion that although
substance abuse is widely regarded as a problem and factor in criminality by both the police and
the community, the hotspots of such detrimental behaviour are often left unchecked.
26 Department of Community Safety, Provincial Crime Overview, 2010/11, unpublished
34
The communities proposed:
That illegal shebeens should be raided on a regular basis not only on weekends and
shebeen owners be arrested and given hefty fines and harsher punishments.
The municipality owned houses used by drug lords for their operations should
be confiscated by the municipality.
Specialised units to deal with drug and liquor outlets should be established.
The closing times of legal shebeens should be monitored..
The police should work in partnership with the community leaders, community structures
and the municipalities in dealing with the substance abuse problem while maintaining
transparency.
As preventative measures, employment and empowerment programmes on
the dangers of substance abuse should be rolled out in communities to
encourage cooperation of the younger generations.
Fighting corruption should be done as it adversely affects community and police
efforts to fight crime.
The most important of all shortcomings regarding the Western Capes efforts against drugs,
is persistent allegations of police corruption in accepting bribes from the drug lords and
shebeen owners to share information on when raids will be done.
Corruption destroys the
trust between police and community members and blunts initiatives to mitigate the drug
trade.
Despite the evident seriousness with which Cape Town police have approached
the drug trade in recent years, identified perceptions of police corruption and complicity
within the drug trade remain high.
4.3.2.5 ADDITIONAL ISSUES RAISED ON POLICING
The communities were asked to give comments on issues which they identified as not being
addressed in the study.
The key issues identified included the following broad themes:
I) TRANSFORMATION OF THE IMAGE OF THE POLICE SERVICE
The police officers should be dedicated, friendly, and treat the community members with
respect and dignity.
The image of the police needs to be improved as some corrupt
police officers damage the image of the service.
The SAPS management should be more
vigorous in dealing with corrupt officials and recruit more reservists.
II) INTEGRATED APPROACH
The police should not work in isolation - more role players like the faith based organisations, Non
Governmental Organisations, Business sectors and Government departments should be
involved and play a role in the fight against crime.
Partnerships between the police and the PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS 35 COMMUNITY SAFETY
CPF needs to improved and CPFs should be recognised as key role players in crime
prevention.
Participation of the broader community should be encouraged through crime
prevention initiatives being rolled out in communities.
III) SAPS MANAGEMENT INVOLVEMENT AND COMMUNICATION WITH COMMUNITIES
The communities are of the view that when new Station Commanders are appointed they
should be introduced to the community leaders and the CPF.
This might result in improved
partnership and communitypolice relations.
Police officials at management level should
not be transferred too often as this also affects service delivery.
The members of the
broader public should be informed through a broad range of media about what is
happening at their individual police stations.
The communities are of the view that the
police should account to them to ensure transparency.
IV) INCENTIVES TO GOOD PERFORMING POLICE OFFICERS
The dedicated good performing police officers should be awarded incentives as a way of
motivating them in their performance.
For the poor performing police officers, counselling
and debriefing sessions should be conducted to boost their morale.

4.4 OVERVIEW OF DISTRICT MUNICIPALITIES AND METROPOLITAN FINDINGS
The following section provides an analysis of data pertaining to the socio-economic profiles,
priority crimes, service delivery issues and recommendations per district municipality.
4.4.1 CAPE WINELANDS DISTRICT MUNICIPALITY
The Cape Winelands District Municipality (CWDM) is situated in the centre of the Western
Cape Province, covering an area of 22 289 km2.
This district has the second largest
population in the Western Cape after the City of Cape Town.
Between 2001 and 2006 the
CWDM's average annual population growth rate was 0,6 per cent27 .
The total population
for Cape Winelands is 712 418.
Unemployment is higher in the larger rural areas, such as
the Stellenbosch area.
Furthermore, it has been estimated that the annual average population growth rate
would slow down to 0,3 per cent between 2006 and 201028, reaching an estimated
population of 656 902 by 2010.
Substance abuse and violence against women and
children are challenges in this area29.
The District Municipality consists of 4 police clusters,
namely Ceres, Stellenbosch, Paarl and Worcester.

All the
frequently mentioned crimes were identified in the previous financial years study with the
exception of drug-related crimes.
III) SERVICE DELIVERY ISSUES
Service delivery issues relate to those issues that influence the shortage of service delivery
by the SAPS.
The issues consist of questions that relate to the suitability of police resources
in addressing crime in the community, utilization of resources, number of police officials in
the CSC, the SAPS' interaction with the public, detective services and the witness
protection programme as well as police visibility and police response time in emergencies.
The graph below illustrates the perceived levels of the first six of the above-mentioned
service delivery categories and a discussion of these follows the graph.

IV) SUITABILITY OF RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING CRIME IN COMMUNITIES
The graph shows that the majority of participants (64%) identified that the police resources
were not suitable in addressing crime in the community, whilst only 36% of participants
identified that these resources were suitable .
V) UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES
Community members were asked whether police resources are being effectively utilized.
majority of participants (58 %) agreed that the resources were being effectively utilized.
Only 42
% of participants indicated that these resources were not being used effectively.
VI) COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTRE
With respect to whether there are enough police officials assisting people in the
Community Service Centre (CSC), the majority of participants (64 %) indicated that they
did not perceive this to be the case.
(A) POLICE CONDUCT AT THE CSC
In the above graph, it can be seen that the majority of participants, (a consensus of 75 %),
indicated that the police officials working within the CSC were polite and helpful towards
community members at the CSC.
This is despite perceiving a shortage in resources.
This is an important statistic when
considering the manner in which police services are delivered to the public and in
creating a trusting relationship between the police and the public.
39
VII) SERVICES RENDERED BY THE DETECTIVES
The majority of participants (58 %) indicated that they were satisfied with the services
rendered by the detectives.
There is a certain amount of difficulty in accurately analysing
how participants are satisfied with the services because they may be influenced by the
outcomes of cases.
Some suggestions, for instance, about what should be done to
improve these services, were to hire more skilled detectives and that more resources
should be provided for the detectives to improve their investigations.
VIII) WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAMME
It is telling that 31 % of participants think that witnesses of crimes are protected.
However,
44 % had no idea whether witnesses received protection from the police, while 25 % of
participants thought that the police did not protect witnesses at all.
This breakdown in
understanding the service of protection that the police provide for witnesses means that
there may be a shortage of confidence in the actual reporting of crimes in the first place
and also of a shortage of expectations of the support, follow-up and outcome of crimes
that have been committed in a community.
Ignorance of the protection that the police provide is one aspect of why participants
answered that they don't know but other, more sinister aspects, suggest that these
participants believe the police to be untrustworthy or as having a non-caring attitude
towards witnesses.

Suggestions for
a better response time included increasing the number of police vehicles, increasing
police visibility, better call-centres and operators increasing police personnel and having
neighbourhood watch programmes implemented in their respective areas.
XI) CPFs INPUT INTO THE POLICE STATION PLANS
The establishment of the CPF was meant to improve community-police relations and make
the police more responsive to the needs of the community.
To achieve this, the CPF of that
community has to have input into the plan of the police station and the allocation of its

4.4.3 CENTRAL KAROO DISTRICT MUNICIPALITY (CKDM)
The Central Karoo District (CKDM) is one of the five districts situated within the Western
Cape Province.
The district comprises of three Local Municipalities namely Beaufort West,
Prince Albert, Laingsburg as well as the DMA, Murraysburg.
With a population of 62,331,
Central Karoo is the smallest district in the Province and possibly nationally, area wise the
District is quite vast covering a total of 38,853 square kilometres giving the district a
population density of about 1.6 hence the lowest population in the country.
Central Karoo
is the largest district in the Western Cape Province; invariably this means that distances
between settlements within the district are vast.
Laingsburg is about 200 km from Beaufort West, while Prince Albert is 170 km31.
The
predominant language in Central Karoo is Afrikaans.
Central Karoo has a 20.5%
unemployment rate.
Thirty five percent (35%) of households earn less than R 9 600 per
annum, and they live below the poverty line.
4.4.2.1 CRIME ISSUES
The CKDM has one police cluster, namely Beaufort West.
In 2005 the CSIR Crime Prevention
Centre (CPC) was tasked to develop a strategy, and to guide the implementation of the
strategy.
The aim was to protect current and future investments made by Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Programme( ISRDP) partners as well as to address the
causes of crime.
The main findings of the study suggest that alcohol abuse, illegal
shebeens, children being neglected and low level of trust between the police and the community.
The abuse of alcohol due to the number of illegal shebeens in the district is a
The high numbers of neglected children who are left unsupervised end up begging on the
streets, using drugs, and hanging around shebeens and game shops due to a shortage of
recreational facilities.
Prostitution in the area, as reported, is closely related to N1 national
road activities.33

Service delivery issues relate to those issues that influence the shortage of service delivery
by the SAPS.
The service delivery issues consist of questions that relate to the suitability of
police resources in addressing crime in the community, utilization of resources, number of
police officials in the CSC, the SAPS' interaction with the public, detective services and the
witness protection programme as well as police visibility and police response time in
emergencies.

were.
The police station that identified that their resources were least suitable was Beaufort West;
while Prince Albert station identified that their resources were suitable.
V) UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES
In response to the question whether police resources are being effectively utilized, he
majority of (57 %) responded negatively whilst only 43 % of participants indicated that
these resources were being used effectively.
This shows a medium disparity between those
that are of the view that resources are being effectively used.
VI) COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTRE
The majority of participants (74 %) indicated that they did not perceive there to be
enough police officials assisting people in the CSC and 26% are of the view that there are
enough police officers at the CSC.

A) POLICE CONDUCT AT THE CSC
The above graph shows 80 % of participants indicated that the police officials working within
the CSC were polite and helpful towards community members at the CSC and 20% do not
concur.
This is despite their perceiving a shortage in both personnel and other resources.
This is
an important statistic when considering the manner in which police services are delivered to
the public and in creating a trusting relationship between the police and the public.
The majority of participants (67 %) indicated that they were satisfied with the services
rendered by the detectives while 33% are not.
There is a certain amount of difficulty in
accurately analysing participants levels of satisfaction with the services as it may be
influenced by the outcomes of cases.
Some suggestions, for instance, on what could be
done to improve these services, are to hire more skilled detectives and that more
resources should be provided for the detectives to improve their investigations.
VIII) WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAMME
Fifty eight percent (58 %) of participants did not know whether witnesses of crimes are
protected, 27 % thought that they were, while 19 % of participants thought that the police did
not protect witnesses.
This breakdown in understanding the service of protection that the
police provide for witnesses means that there may be a shortage of confidence in the actual
reporting of crimes in the first place and also of a shortage of expectations of the support,
follow-up and outcome of crimes that have been committed in a community.
Lack of
awareness of the protection that the police provide to witnesses of crime is one aspect why
participants answered that they do not know whether witnesses of crime are protected.

With seven local municipalities and the South Cape District Management Area (DMA), Eden
District Municipality is the second largest district municipality in the Western Cape Province. The
district shares its borders with four other district municipalities, namely Cacadu DM in the
Eastern Cape Province, Overberg DM, Winelands DM and Central Karoo DM.
In 1996, 9,6 per cent of the Western Cape's population resided in the Eden District
Municipality, rising to 10,1 per cent in 2001 but projected to remain unchanged until 2010.
Unemployment is a problem and more pronounced amongst females, Africans and the
youth, especially in George and Oudtshoorn.
The unemployment rate and the number of
residents who had no income in 2001 are key indicators of the level of poverty in Eden
District40.
The Eden District Municipality consists of three police clusters, namely George, Da

IV) SUITABILITY OF RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING CRIME IN COMMUNITIES
The graph shows that the majority of participants (77%) identified that the police resources
were not suitable in addressing crime in the community while only (23%) of participants
identified that these resources were suitable.
The participants are of the view that the police
vehicles are not available for assistance in the areas that they are required.
Due to the
distance between sectors, the response time to crime situations was also identified as some of
the obstacles in service delivery.
Some areas and sectors are reportedly too big for the
allocated resources.
In areas with satellite police stations that rely on main stations, it is very
difficult to get police to crime situations on time, due to the shortage of vehicles and personnel.
V) UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES
Community members were asked whether police resources are being effectively utilized.
An equal number of participants (50%/50 %) responded both positively and negatively.
The participants who are of the view that resources are not utilized effectively are of the
opinion that the police officers misuse the vehicles. .
Some police officers are allegedly
found in places unrelated to work and they ignore community complaints.
In some areas
the police officers abuse their power and are rude when addressing community members.
On a positive note, 50% of participants indicate that the police are doing their best given
the allocated resources at their police stations.
The police officers attend to crime
situations on time in certain areas.

VI) COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTRE
Community members responded as to whether members perceive there to be enough
police officials assisting people in the Community Service Centre (CSC).
The majority of participants (64 %) indicated negatively and 36% are of the view that there are enough
police officers at the CSC.
The participants suggest, among other things, that the police officers should answer the
telephone immediately, police officers should be polite and friendly and more police
officers should be deployed on duty to improve service delivery at the CSC.
A) POLICE CONDUCT AT THE CSC
The majority of participants (73%) indicate that the police officials working at the CSC are
polite and helpful towards community members and 27% are of a contrary view.
This is
despite their perception that there is a shortage in both personnel and other resources.
This is an important statistic when considering the manner in which police services are
delivered to the public and delivering in creating a trusting relationship between the
police and the public.
VII) SERVICES RENDERED BY THE DETECTIVES
Fifty six percent of the participants (56%) indicated that they are satisfied with the services
rendered by the detectives and 44% are not satisfied.
The participants indicated that the
detectives investigate crimes in a satisfactory manner, although they are under-staffed,
but they are doing their best in ensuring that the criminals are put behind bars.
On the
other hand the participants (44%) who are not satisfied claim that the detectives do not
provide feedback to complainants, no thorough investigations are conducted that result
in conviction rates and they take too long to solve cases due to backlogs.
There is a certain amount of difficulty in accurately analysing how participants are satisfied
with the services rendered, because they may be influenced by the outcomes of cases.
Some suggestions, for instance, about what could be done to improve these services were
to reduce the detectives work load, providing the detectives with more resources and
more training could improve their investigations.
VIII) WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAMME
The majority (49%) of participants do not know whether witnesses of crimes are protected,
31% are of the view that they are while 20% are of the view that the witnesses of crime are
not protected at all.
This breakdown in understanding the service of protection that the
police provide for witnesses, means that there may be a shortage of confidence in the
actual reporting of crimes in the first place and also of a shortage of expectations of the
support, follow-up and outcome of crimes that have been committed in a community.

PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS
61
(A) POLICE CONDUCT AT THE CSC
In the above graph, it can be seen that the majority of participants, (76 %) indicated that
the police officials working within the CSC were polite and helpful towards community
members.
This is despite perceiving a shortage in resources.
This is an important statistic
when considering the manner in which police services are delivered to the public and in
creating a trusting relationship between the police and the public.
VII) SERVICES RENDERED BY THE DETECTIVES
The majority of participants (61%) indicated that they were satisfied with the services
rendered by the detectives.
There is a certain amount of difficulty in accurately analysing how participants are satisfied
with the services because they may be influenced by the outcomes of cases.
Some
suggestions, for instance, about what could be done to improve these services, were to
hire more skilled detectives and that more resources should be provided for the detectives
to work with to improve their investigations.
St Helena Bay scored the best at being
perceived as the station where detectives render their services satisfactorily.
VIII) WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAMME
Twenty four percent of the participants (24%) think that witnesses of crimes are protected.
However, 23% did not know if the police protect witnesses, whilst 53% of participants
thought that the police did not protect witnesses at all.
This breakdown in understanding
the service of protection that the police provide for witnesses means that there may be a
shortage of confidence in the actual reporting of crimes in the first place and also of a
shortage of expectations of the support, follow-up and outcome of crimes that have been
committed in a community.
Lack of awareness of the protection that the police provide
to witnesses of crime is one aspect of why participants answered that they don't know but
other, more sinister aspects, suggest that these participants believe the police to be
untrustworthy or as having a non-caring attitude towards witnesses.

PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS

The establishment of the CPF was meant to improve community-police relations and make
the police more responsive to the needs of the community.
To achieve this, the CPF of that
community has to have input into the plan of the police station and the allocation of its
resources by the SAPS.
When asked if the CPF of their area provided input into the plan of the police station, 62 %
indicated that they did while 5 % responded that the CPF does not provide input into the
station plan and the majority (33%) do not know.
Asked about whether the CPF gave input into how resources are allocated by the police,
the majority of members (55 %) indicated that they do, 9% do not and 36% do not know
whether the CPF gives input in the way resources are allocated in their areas.
4.4.6 WEST COAST DISTRICT MUNICIPALITY
The West Coast District consists of two clusters, namely Vredendal and Vredenburg.
In
addition, of 25 police stations that fall into this district, Malmesbury and Riebeeck West fall
into the Paarl Cluster and Porterville, which falls under the Ceres Cluster.
Both these clusters
are looked at in detail in the district analysis of the Cape Winelands Municipal District,
which borders on the West Coast District.

COMMUNITY SAFETY
Service delivery issues relate to those issues that influence the shortage of service delivery by the
SAPS.
These consist of questions that relate to the suitability of police resources in addressing
interaction with the public, detective services and the witness protection programme as well as
police visibility and police response time in emergencies.
The graph illustrates the perceived levels of the first six of the above-mentioned service delivery
categories and a discussion of these follows the graph.
IV) SUITABILITY OF RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING CRIME IN COMMUNITIES
The graph shows that the majority (62%) of participants identified that the police resources were
not suitable in addressing crime in the community while only 38% of participants identified that
these resources were suitable .
V) UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES
Community members were asked whether police resources are being effectively utilized.
The
majority of participants (69%) indicated that the resources were being effectively utilized.
Only 31%
of participants indicated that these resources were not being used effectively.
VI) COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTRE
Community members responded as to whether members perceive there to be enough police
officials assisting people in the Community Service Centre (CSC).
Half of the participants (50%)
indicated that they there was not and the other half (50%) are of the view that there are enough
police officers
(A) POLICE CONDUCT AT THE CSC
In the above graph, it can be seen that the majority of participants (86%) indicated that the police
officials working within the CSC were polite and helpful towards community members at the CSC.
This is despite perceiving a shortage in resources.
This is an important statistic when considering
the manner in which police services are delivered to the public and in creating a trusting
relationship between the police and the public.
VII) SERVICES RENDERED BY THE DETECTIVES
The majority of participants (78%) indicated that they were satisfied with the services rendered by
the detectives.
There is a certain amount of difficulty in accurately analysing how participants are
satisfied with the services because they may be influenced by the outcomes of cases.
Some
suggestions, for instance, about what could be done to improve these services were to hire more
skilled detectives and that more resources should be provided for the detectives to work with to
improve their investigations.
VIII) WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAMME
It is telling that 49% of participants did not know that witnesses of crimes are protected.
However,
44% did know that the police protect witnesses, while 16% of participants thought that the police
did not protect witnesses.
REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLICING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE (2010/11)
66
This breakdown in understanding the service of protection that the police provide for witnesses
means that there may be a shortage of confidence in the actual reporting of crimes in the first place
and also of a shortage of expectations of the support, follow-up and outcome of crimes that have
been committed in a community.
Lack of awareness of the protection that the police provide to
witnesses of crime is one aspect of why participants answered that they do not know, but other
more sinister aspects, suggest that these participants believe the police to be untrustworthy or as
having a non-caring attitude toward witnesses.

areas.
Forty one percent 41% are of the view that increasing police patrols during the night while
29% are of the view that police patrols during the day would increase police visibility.
A clear
percent of participants (52%) are of the view that more stop and search operations in the area
should be conducted.
Forty seven percent (47%) of participants are of the view that the full
implementation of sector policing should be done to decrease crime in their areas.
X) POLICE RESPONSE TIME TO AN EMERGENCY
To assist in an emergency, a clear majority (65%) of community members indicated 5-10 minutes
as an appropriate police response time and 21% are of the view that the police should respond no
longer than 15 minutes to emergencies.
The remaining 14% identified that the police could respond
from 20 minutes to an hour to crime emergencies.
The participants (82%) are of the view that increasing police visibility or patrols in their areas and
increasing the number of police vehicles (47%) would improve police response times to calls for
assistance.
As a recommendation those participants indicated that foot, bicycle and horse patrols
could be more effective than vehicle patrols.
Furthermore, more police officers and vehicles should
be deployed to patrol the crime hotspots like the routes from shebeens, public transport routes etc.
43 Some of the participants selected more than one service delivery category which means that the total of percentages will not add up to 100%.

visibility was requested to increase.
Participants from Tulbagh highlighted the shortage of police vehicles and the effect this has on
crime prevention.
Participants noted the need for the police to provide the community with greater
In the Prince Albert Hamlet, participants identified the shortage of police personnel due to the
large geographical area the station serves.
As a consequence, police officials are often unavailable
to attend to all call outs and thus police visibility is limited.

X) ADDITIONAL COMMENTS PERTAINING TO THE PAARL POLICE CLUSTER
Residents in Mbekweni mentioned drugs as a special concern in their area.
Residents were quite
satisfied with police visibility in their area and are of the view that the patrols are being executed in
an acceptable manner.
They believe more police attention is needed in Sector 3 and the squatter
camps.
While they recognised the monthly community meeting, they lamented the fact that CPFs
were not given an opportunity to give input into the police plans for resource allocation.
Community
members stress the importance of a cooperative effort between the police and community to
combat major problems like drug abuse.
In Paarl a special concern is the theft of cables.
While this could be a prevalent crime, it is not one
that is often mentioned in other clusters.
Residents are of the view that police resources should be
better utilized and that there needs to be a more visible police presence at all times to help combat
crime.
There is also a feeling that the staff in the community centres should be able to speak the
local dominant languages to better serve their constituents.
Community members are of the view
that more attention needs to be paid to policing the farm areas and to properly allocate resources.
In reference to the issue of illegal distribution centres for substances, they are of the view that there
needs to be more consistent enforcement of bi-laws.
Community members from Paarl East mentioned sexual offences, child abuse, and scrap dealing
as special areas of concern.
They are also of the opinion that police vehicles are not appropriately
matched to the local terrain through which they should navigate to fight crime.
Suggestions to
rectify this are plans of more motorcycles or off-road vehicles.
They are of the view that the police
have neither sufficient resources nor do they use the available resources effectively.
Members
identified it as important to mention that they are not happy with the level of service provided by
detectives in their area.
There is also a desire that the Chicago area be more tightly controlled.
The
consensus is that the CPF in their area is dysfunctional and inadequate at representing the
communitys interests.
In Philadelphia the residents reported a growing substance abuse problem in the rural areas.
They mentioned a lack of attention paid by the police to petty crimes that may be seen as
REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLICING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE (2010/11)
74
less serious than crimes like murder.
These petty crimes still need police intervention.
They are of
the view that the resources are appropriate to combat local crime and suggest the introduction of 4
x 4 vehicles to help police resources be used more effectively.
While residents are largely happy
with the detectives services, they feel that continued vigilance and participation is needed.
The
Klipheuwel area is mentioned as a place where a greater police presence is needed.
Community
members are of the view that they should be involved and engaged in the processes taking place
in their policing area.
They also are of the view that police should consider road crimes when
patrolling as the N7 road presents major safety hazards for the local community.
The majority of the Wellington CPF participants are unhappy with the material preparedness and
personnel of the police force, citing this as a growing frustration in the pursuit of community safety.
Residents identified that police visibility needs to be increased across all sectors especially 2 and
3.
While there is recognition that meetings are held, it is unclear whether community members feel
that the relationship between the CPFs and police is effectively promoting safety.
Members are
also of the view that better communication is needed between the CPF and SAPS.
While in most
other areas residents thought the police should do more raids of illegal shebeens, in Wellington
there is a sense that community members should be responsible for keeping these establishments
out of their own area with the support of police.

X) ADDITIONAL COMMENTS PERTAINING TO THE BELLVILLE POLICE CLUSTER
The Bellville participants are of the opinion that more reservists should be employed. Better
management of resources is a priority.
Ensure that the Morpho Touch is always available and that
a competent member operates it.
The area needs more police visibility, more competent members
and more vehicles.
According to participants a major problem is the absence of joint action by SAPS and Metro police.
It is suggested that the Metro Police that should be on board to police the by-laws are absent.
SAPS should make better use of partnerships with business and social development organisations.
All relevant role players should get involved in fighting crime i.e. SAPS, City of Cape Town officials,
Home affairs and Department of Social Development.
In Bothasig there is a problem with language where the police officers deployed at the station,
cannot speak the language of the complainants.
There is a need to adequately train members to
speak English, to have telephone etiquette and properly address the public.
The police station
needs to be extended.
More resources like police officers and vehicles are requested.
In Goodwood the CPF are of the view that the police station should have a crime prevention
section that will not only be reactive, but proactive in preventing crime.
In Parow language remains a problem.
In a dominant Afrikaans area the police officers deployed
at the CSC should be able to address the public in preferred language of the complainants.
Basic training in customer care and client relations is necessary for the police officers.
It is requested that
more police operations and community involvement should be implemented.
More neighbourhood
watches and block watches should be formed.

4.7.2 BISHOP LAVIS POLICE CLUSTER
The Bishop Lavis Police Cluster consists of three police stations, namely Bishop Lavis, Elsies River
and Langa police stations.
All CPFs participated in the PNPs survey.
I) TOP PRIORITY CRIMES
TABLE 22: BISHOP LAVIS CLUSTER COMMUNITY IDENTIFIED PNPs (COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS)
The participants of the Bishop Lavis cluster perceive assault BGH and sexual offences to be the
top priority crimes.
II) SUITABILITY OF RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING CRIME IN COMMUNITIES
The majority (64%) of participants felt that the police resources were not suitable in addressing
crime in the community while only 36% of participants felt that these resources were suitable.
The police station that felt that their resources were least suitable was Langa (100%) police station
while Bishop Lavis (60%) police station felt that their resources were suitable.
III) UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES
Community members were asked whether police resources are being effectively utilized. The
majority of participants (58%) said that the resources were not being effectively utilized. Only 42%
of participants said that these resources were being used effectively.
This shows a small disparity
between those that feel that resources are being effectively used and those who responded that
resources are not effectively utilized.
Some of the indicators of how this was perceived were by
looking at the total of participants who did not know how many policemen were allocated to their
police station and how many police vehicles were available to service their police station's district.
IV) COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTRE
Community members responded as to whether members perceive there to be enough police
officials assisting people in the Community Service Centre (CSC).
The majority of participants
(69%) indicated that they did not perceive there to be enough police officials assisting people in the
CSC. The most affected station was Bishop Lavis (100%) and the least affected station is Langa
(50%).
COMMUNITY SAFETY
89
(A) POLICE CONDUCT AT THE CSC
The majority of participants (60%) indicated that the police officials working within the CSC were
polite and helpful towards community members at the CSC.
This is despite their perceiving a lack
in both personnel and other resources.
This is an important statistic when considering the manner
in which police services are delivered to the public and forming a trusting relationship between the
police and the public.
The most satisfied station was Bishop Lavis (83%) and the least satisfied
station was Elsies River (100%)
The majority of participants (60%) indicated that they were not satisfied with the services rendered
by the detectives.
There is a certain amount of difficulty in accurately analysing how to measure
participants level of satisfaction, because it may be influenced by the outcomes of cases.
most affected station was Elsies River (100%) and the least affected station was Bishop Lavis
(100%).
Some suggestions, for instance, on what could be done to improve these services were to
hire more skilled detectives and that more resources be provided for the detectives to work with to
improve their investigations.
It is telling that 38% of participants did not know whether witnesses of crimes are protected.
About
19% thought that they were, while 44% of participants indicated that the police do not protect
witnesses.
This breakdown in understanding the service of protection that the police provide for
witnesses can be attributed that there may be a lack of confidence in the actual reporting of crimes
in the first place and also of a lack of expectations of the support, follow-up and outcome of crimes
that have been committed in a community.
Lack of awareness of the protection that the police
provide to witnesses of crime is one aspect of why participants answered that they don not know,
but other more sinister aspects, suggest that these participants believe the police to be
untrustworthy or as having a non-caring attitude towards witnesses.
VII) POLICE VISIBILITY
The majority of community members (63%) indicated that more police patrols during the day and
night would improve police visibility in their respective areas.
The majority of participants in Elsies
River (100%) and Langa (71%) request more patrols during the day and night.
More stop and
search operations were considered by 58% as being useful in increasing police visibility.
In Elsies River (100%) and Langa (57%) the majority of participants indicated that more stop and
search operations should be conducted.
Full implementation of sector policing was considered by
68% as a means of improving police visibility.
The majority of participants in Elsies River (100%)
and Langa (71%) suggested the full implementation of sector policing to improve police visibility.
To assist in an emergency, a clear majority (88%) of community members indicated 5-10 minutes
as an appropriate police response time while only 12% felt that longer than 15 minutes was
acceptable as a response time in the case of an emergency.
The majority of
REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLICING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE (2010/11)
90 participants at all police stations agree that 5-10 minutes is an appropriate police response time in
their respective areas.
IX) CPFs INPUT INTO THE POLICE STATION PLANS
When asked if the CPF of their area provided input into the plan of the police station, 43% said that
they did while 50% responded that they did not know.
Elsies River (67%) was the most affected
station while Bishop Lavis (50%) and Langa (50%) were the least affected.
Asked about whether
the CPF provided input into the way resources are allocated by the police, the majority of members
(29%) indicated that they did while 57% responded that they did not know. Bishop Lavis (80%) was
the most affected station while Langa (50%) was the least affected.
X) ADDITIONAL COMMENTS PERTAINING TO THE BISHOP LAVIS POLICE CLUSTER
Lavis.
Maintaining a good relationship with community structures by the police is crucial in the fight
against crime.
During the Community Safety Barometer project 2008/09, the participants identified robbery,
murder and shootings as the most feared crimes.
Provision of recreational facilities and activities
for the youth, eliminate gangsters from their communities, develop neighbourhood watches, deploy
police officers outside of the areas in which they themselves live and involving the Metro police in
community policing were some of the interventions that government can embark on in addressing
the crime challenges in Bishop Lavis.
In Langa it is requested that Police should visit schools regularly and search the learners during
the intervals as they are sometimes found with dagga and knives.
Police should be visible at four way stops as this is where motorists are robbed of their belongings.
Daily patrols are needed.
Schools are no longer safe spaces and police should search the learners
during their breaks.
More police patrols and police visibility at four way stops as the criminals take
advantage of vulnerable motorists.
In Elsies River it is requested that police officers be educated in service excellence.
More foot
patrols and more policing at shebeens.
Keep vehicles on patrol and stagger shift changes.
Police
requests to focus on teenage delinquency and get all school going children re-entering the school.
Police should treat communities equally.

were reported as the number 1 crime priority in the different areas.
II) SUITABILITY OF RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING CRIME IN COMMUNITIES
The majority of participants (59%) felt that the police resources were not suitable in addressing
crime in the community while only 37% of participants felt that these resources were suitable. The
police station that felt that their resources were least suitable was Camps Bay and Table Bay
Harbour, while Cape Town Central and Kensington stations felt that their resources were suitable.
92
III) UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES
Community members were asked whether police resources are being effectively utilized.
The majority of participants (57%) found that the resources were being effectively utilized.
Only 31% of participants said that these resources were not being used effectively.
Woodstock Police Station
scored the best where 83% of participants believed that resources were being used effectively.
The one respondent that did answer this question for Camps Bay Police Station indicated that they
did not utilize their resources efficiently which makes Camps Bay Police station the lowest scorer
on the effective utilization of resources.
IV) COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTRE
Community members responded to the question whether members perceive there to be enough
police officials assisting people in the Community Service Centre (CSC).
The majority of
participants (46%) indicated that they did perceive there to be enough police officials assisting
people in the CSC, while 44% thought that there were not enough.
Sea Point Station scored the
highest on this point while both Camps Bay and Table Bay participants scored lower as these
stations do not have enough police officers assisting in their CSC's.
(A) POLICE CONDUCT AT THE CSC
The majority of participants, a consensus of 70%, indicated that the police officials working within
the CSC were polite and helpful towards community members at the CSC.
This is despite their perceiving a lack in both personnel and other resources.
This is an important statistic when considering the manner in which police services are delivered to
the public and in creating a trusting relationship between the police and the public.
Again Camps
Bay was the police station where the police was considered as the least helpful and friendly, while
Table Bay Harbour Police Station, despite the participants believing them to have the least suitable
resources and personal assisting in the CSC, scored the highest as having helpful and polite police
assisting in their CSC.
V) SERVICES RENDERED BY THE DETECTIVES
The majority of participants (52%) indicated that they were satisfied with the services rendered by
the detectives.
At the Camps Bay and Sea Point police stations participants were most satisfied
with the services that detectives rendered, while Maitland was the station where the participants
were least satisfied with detective services.
75% of the participants feel that the detectives
rendered satisfactory services.
There is a certain amount of difficulty in accurately analysing why participants feel satisfied with the
services, because they may be influenced by the outcomes of cases.
Some suggestions, for
instance, on what could be done to improve these services were to hire more skilled detectives and
that more resources should be provided for the detectives to work with to improve their
investigations.
COMMUNITY SAFETY
93
VI) WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAMME
It is telling that 74 % of participants did not know whether witnesses of crimes are protected.
Only 17% thought that they were, while 6 % of the participants thought that the police did not protect
witnesses.
Camps Bay, Sea Point and Woodstock stations were all equal in their participants not
knowing if the police provide protection for witnesses in criminal cases.
Only 38% of participants of Pinelands Police Station said that the police did provide police
protection, making this police station the highest scorer in terms of participants that believed that
the police provide protection to witnesses in criminal cases.
Table Bay Harbour Police Station
scored the worst in this respect with 25% of participants thinking that the police did not provide
witness protection. This breakdown in understanding the service of protection that the police provide for witnesses
means that there may be a lack of confidence in the actual reporting of crimes in the first place and
also of a lack of expectations of the support, follow-up and outcome of crimes that have been
committed in a community.
Lack of awareness of the protection that the police provide to witnesses
of crime is a factor why participants answered that they do not know but other, more sinister
aspects, suggest that these participants believe the police to be untrustworthy or as having a non-
caring attitude towards witnesses.
Below we look at other aspects that affect the participants' perception of the service delivery of the
police in their areas:
VII) POLICE VISIBILITY
About 25.8% of the participants indicated that more police patrols during the day and night would
improve police visibility in their respective areas.
However only 11.7% felt that increasing police
patrols during the day would increase police visibility and 12.5% felt that increasing night patrols
would increase police visibility in the area.
More stop and search operations were considered by
25% and full implementation of sector policing was considered by 23.4% as a means of improving
police visibility.
To assist in an emergency, a clear majority of community members (92.6%) indicated 5-10 minutes
as an appropriate police response time while only 5.6% felt that 10-15 minutes was acceptable as
a response time in the case of an emergency.
The establishment of the CPF was meant to improve community-police relations and make the
police more responsive to the needs of the community.
To achieve this, the CPF of that community
needs to provide input into the plan of the police station and the allocation of its resources by the SAPS.
When asked if the CPF of their area provided input into the plan of the police station, 43% said that
they did while 35% responded that they did not know.
Asked about whether the CPF gave input
into the way resources are allocated by the police, the majority of members (46%) indicated that
they did give input.

X) ADDITIONAL COMMENTS PERTAINING TO THE CAPE TOWN POLICE CLUSTER
Camps Bay participants agree that improved training, improve calibre of recruits, better work
ethics and approach to service, better equipment suitable for environment, better utilization and
deployment of resources should be attended to.
In Cape Town Central the CPF is of the opinion that more reservists should be recruited and
compensated.
The number of foot and horse patrols need to be increased day and night.
Training
of officers, ensuring that SAPS vehicles are roadworthy and fully kitted, more direct community
interaction, meeting and knowing your local SAPS officers should be done.
SAPS need better
working conditions, equipment, training and support.
Police should be trained to be more friendly and competent.
The "Shoot to Kill" rule should be
revisited as innocent people are killed in crossfire.
The selling of toy guns to the children promotes
violent behaviour and should be banned.
Proper values and principles should be instilled in the
growing youth; the selling of firearms and the licences should be stopped.
Detectives and
investigating officer's units should be brought to the sector teams in order to ensure accountability
and a better conviction rate.
Individual SAPS members performance should be monitored on a daily basis.
There is a need to
police illegal drug dealers more vigilantly, a zero tolerance approach to criminals and the need to
utilise all resources including by-laws in the fight against crime.
Community cohesion should be strengthened; community police relations should be improved,
establishment of recreational facilities to keep unemployed youth, shortage of confidentiality create
problems.
All stakeholders involved including the communities need to go back to basics.
There is
a need for passion to fight crime in all areas and to gain respect.
To ensure that sector teams are
retained and do not move officers around.
In Kensington the participants are of the view that community watchers should be given more
consideration.
The police should try to gain the communitys trust.
The community requests that the
sector phone be answered at all times.
In Maitland there is a need for more police officials and police vans.
In Pinelands the number of police officers, vehicles and sector patrols should be increased.
More
trained and better equipped staff with a positive attitude towards the community.
The CPF is in
need of new two-way radios to be used when assisting the police in their operations.
The Department of Community Safety is requested to assist the CPF with resources like two-way
radios.
The Department should gain clarity of its role over the CPFs.
Communication between
police and community needs to be improved.
Police officers deployed at the CSC should be
capacitated to be able to answer telephone in a professional manner when dealing with community
complaints.
Better and proper training of members is a request.
Members need to be trained to
deal properly with public.
Police visibility should be improved en route to railway stations.
In Sea Point the issue of illegal activities like prostitution, rent boys (male prostitutes) and vagrants
should be addressed because the police are ignoring these problems.
Sector managers are in
need of laptops.
SAPS members need to receive incentives to encourage them to carry out their
work more efficiently.
There should be a partnership and trust between the local police and the residents.
In Table Bay Harbour more police, more patrol vehicles are

requested.
It is requested that in Camps Bay the police training should be conducted to improve
calibre of recruits, better work ethics and approach to service, better equipment suitable for
environment, better utilization and deployment of resources.
In Woodstock the participants are of the view that the police station is not in an acceptable
condition.
There is a suggestion that the station needs to be located close to sector 1 where there
is more crime.
The sector managers should have a team reporting to them and the team should be
acquainted with the sector.
At present the teams report to shift managers who are not action or
operational people.
Shift managers should be redeployed to streets and sectors so that they are
proactive rather than reactive.
More senior officers in the management team are needed.
Police in
charge of his/her sector should have a database of all known offenders in that community.
In
Woodstock the police should comply with the code of conduct.
In Maitland participants requests a bigger police station.

In Belhar participants indicated that the police station is small and cannot accommodate community needs.
The police are requested to get to acquaint themselves with community
organisations.
Communication skills training for the front desk staff should be conducted to ensure
that the police officers are more community-friendly.
There is a request that when new police
officers are appointed the station commander should introduce them to community leaders.
Good
police officers should be recognised and bad policing should be reported.
Some police officers use
drugs and purchase it within the community.
This tarnishes the image of the police.
A screening
process should be in place for officers and action should be taken against those who contravene.

II) SUITABILITY OF RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING CRIME IN COMMUNITIES
The majority of participants (66%) felt that the police resources were not suitable in addressing
crime in the community, while only 29% of participants felt that these resources were suitable. The
police station that felt that their resources were least suitable was Harare while Macassar station
felt that their resources were suitable.
III) UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES
Community members were asked whether police resources are being effectively utilized.
The
majority of participants (50 %) found that the resources were not being effectively utilized.
About 43
% of participants said that these resources were being used effectively.
Both Harare and Gordons
Bay Stations unanimously felt that their resources were being effectively utilized while Macassar
Police Station shows that this is where participants most thought that resources where not being
effectively utilized.
IV) COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTRE
Community members responded as to whether members perceive there to be enough police
officials assisting people in the Community Service Centre (CSC).
The majority of participants
(66%) indicated that they did not perceive there to be enough police officials assisting people in the
CSC with Gordons Bay scoring the highest.
Macassar is the police station where there was least
thought to be enough police officials assisting at the CSC.
(A) POLICE CONDUCT AT THE CSC
The majority of participants, 50%, indicated that the police officials working within the CSC were
neither polite nor helpful towards community members at the CSC.
Roughly 47% of participants to
this question, however, did feel that the police were polite and helpful.
Harare station scored the
worst as the participants believe that the police were neither polite nor helpful while Gordons Bay
scored the best at their participants indicating that the police at their station were helpful and
friendly.
V) SERVICES RENDERED BY THE DETECTIVES.
The majority of participants (55%) indicated that they were not satisfied with the services rendered
by the detectives.
Lwandle was the station where the participants were least satisfied with the
services while Gordons bay again scored the best with all those that responded to this question
feeling that the detectives did render satisfactory services.
There is a certain amount of difficulty in accurately analysing why participants feel satisfied with the
services, because they may be influenced by the outcomes of cases.
Some suggestions, for
instance, on what could be done to improve these services were to hire more skilled detectives and
that more resources should be provided for the detectives to work with to improve their
investigations.
VI) WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAMME
Thirty eight percent of the participants (38 %) did not know whether witnesses of crimes are
protected.
However, 31% thought that they were and 21% of participants thought that the police did
not protect witnesses.
The single respondent to this question said that Gordons Bay did
COMMUNITY SAFETY
PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS
103
protect witnesses, but also 90% of participants to this question at Harare Police Station said that
the police protected witnesses in criminal cases.
Lwandle scored high as the place where the
majority of participants thought that the police did not protect witnesses, while all the participants at
Somerset West did not know whether the police protected witnesses in criminal cases.
This breakdown in understanding the service of protection that the police provide for witnesses
means that there may be a lack of confidence in the actual reporting of crimes in the first place and
also of a lack of expectations of the support, follow-up and outcome of crimes that have been
committed in a community.
Below we look at other aspects that affect the participants' perception of the service delivery of the
police in their areas:
VII) POLICE VISIBILITY
Full implementation of sector policing was considered by 28% of respondents as a means of
improving police visibility.
More stop and search operations were considered by 23.8% as being
useful in increasing police visibility.
Of the participants, 26.6% indicated that more police patrols
during the day and night would improve police visibility in their respective areas and 11.2% felt that
increasing police patrols during the night would increase police visibility.
10.5% felt that increasing
day patrols would increase police visibility in the area.
VIII) POLICE RESPONSE TIME TO AN EMERGENCY
To assist in an emergency, a clear majority (60%) of community members indicated 5-10 minutes
as an appropriate police response time while only 21.8% felt that 10-15 minutes was acceptable as
a response time in the case of an emergency.
IX) CPFs INPUT INTO THE POLICE STATION PLANS
The establishment of the CPF was meant to improve community-police relations and make the
police more responsive to the needs of the community.
To achieve this, the CPF of that community
has to have input into the plan of the police station and the allocation of its resources by the SAPS.
When asked if the CPF of their area provided input in the plan of the police station, 41% said that
they did while 28% responded that they did not know.
Asked about whether the CPF provided input
in the way resources are allocated by the police, 50% indicated that they did.
X) ADDITIONAL COMMENTS PERTAINING TO THE KHAYELITSHA POLICE CLUSTER
In Gordons Bay participants indicated that street children, vagrants and beggars, street racing at
night (Fridays and Saturdays), Illegal parking attendants, bars open after 02:00 is a huge challenge
in the area that needs to be addressed by the police.
Security and control within municipal
properties e.g. caravan park and Koggel Bay should be improved.
Cable theft seems to be a
constant problem.
With only one vehicle and an area made up of mostly unlit roads makes this a
difficult problem to address.
In Harare the participants are of the view that the police should monitor their areas and
communicate with community members.
Foot patrol of police members should be implemented.
REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLICING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE (2010/11)
104
During the Minister of Community Safetys visit in Harare the community members raised service
delivery issues that includes the following issues:
N) Shortage of co-operation from SAPS;
O) SAPS not patrolling on foot but in vehicles; requesting torches and jackets
P) An increase in selling of drugs; information about drug merchants leak out when
reported to SAPS and patrollers who are possibly injured whilst patrolling;
Q) SAPS assault people without reason when they conduct patrols and searches,
R) Shortage of service delivery issues (visibility of SAPS Flying Squad, telephone etiquette,
and
S) Shortage of communication with community structures.
In Lwandle participants suggest that CPF members and NHW members should work hand in hand
with the police in conducting patrols.
Reservists should be trained.
CPF should have name tags
and the Department of Community Safety should visit CPF members at least once a month.
Police
are urged not to drink during working hours.
The police should patrol the area with the CPF,
NHWes.
On weekends they should close shebeens.
Those licensed shebeens should be
monitored to comply with closing times.
There is a request that in Lwandle the CPF should be registered.
The CPF and NHWes should
have benefits so that they should be motivated in their work.
Finally, CPF members should have a
close relationship with SAPS.
They can patrol with the police and SANCO and street committees
should account to the CPF and CPF to the police.
Participants in Somerset West are of the view that the police should address the problem of
vagrants in the area.
We know that these people often act as spotters for criminals.
With the
demographics of Somerset West and taking into account the high number of robberies a dog unit
and a horse unit is of paramount importance.
Police should provide support and information to the
community structure or community leaders, work with them to provide them with more insight on
issues to enable them to keep the community informed.
Macassar participants suggested that the police officers should be professional, dedicated, very
strict and proud to be members of SAPS.
High morale and dignity are recommended.
Colleagues
and community members need to respect each other.
The police should give positive meaning to
the word S.A.P.S. To get better police delivery, the station should get rid of corrupt police officers.
SAPS should get reliable, honest and hardworking officers.
Police are requested to respond faster
when they are called to crime situations.
The police should plan together with schools and other
parts of society in order to prevent the root causes of ill diseases such as drugs.
The community is
Afrikaans- speaking and therefore Afrikaans-speaking officers should be employed in Macassar
police station.
The Strand participants cited that more reservists should be deployed and be provided with
appropriate training.
In Lingelethu West participants propose that more patrols especially on week ends should be
conducted in the informal settlements like Monwabisi Park and next to the railway routes.
Visit
schools to raise awareness on drug, alcohol and sex abuse.
The participants request that stations
have separate jails for the juveniles and adults.
Police should try to commit themselves to the
community.
Police officers that misbehave toward community members need to attend workshops
to improve their human relations.

shortage of personnel is limiting the police departments ability to effectively and efficiently
deal with crime.

abuse is a major problem and as a result increases the numbers of crimes that are
committed in their area.
They identified that while the police were quite visible, their
inclusion and protection of witnesses of crimes were absent.
They were also the only area
to mention a problem with the policing of informal settlements.

resources.
Overall there was a sense of disappointment regarding the thoroughness of the
police officers in their follow-up to reported crimes.
At Gansbaai participants mentioned that there is a problem with criminally inclined

visibility and effectiveness.

not enough racial and cultural diversity in the police staff.
They site a small capacity for languages to be especially problematic.
They see the
Compound area as being in need of more policing.

police in the community.

X) ADDITIONAL COMMENTS PERTAINING TO THE VREDENDAL POLICE CLUSTER
Some suggestions at Citrusdal were that officers should be more dedicated and that
resources should be used more respectfully.
It was mentioned that some members in the
community are of the view that the police may be corrupt.
Members identified that there
was a shortage of police presence at farms, at the river-dumping sites and squatter
camps/ disadvantaged areas, as well as on the Hexriver Bridge - out of the town.
There was a complaint that the police are not visible at all.
Several people identified that
more police officers needed to be employed at their station and that confidentiality
should be taken seriously.
It was also mentioned that sometimes the police are unable to
respond to a call out, citing the shortage of police vans as the reason.
At Clanwilliam participants identified that service delivery needed to be enhanced.
One
recurring remark was that language seemed to be a barrier in this respect and that more
accountable, committed and trained personnel along with better management was needed.
It was also mentioned that "uneducated" police should be evaluated through due process,
which again suggests that better training is needed.
It was thought that officers' morale could
be increased by better debriefing and counselling sessions.
It was also suggested that the
sharing of information from the police to the public was cited as a problem.
More police
visibility was requested at sports fields, schools, farms and business areas.
It was also raised that
there are too few policemen and police vehicles available, but it was suggested that other
departments help the SAPS with their workload where they can.
At Doringbaai it was indicated that there is a shortage of personnel and resources.
To
improve police accountability it was suggested that there is more openness between the
police and the community.
Elandsbaai identified that more police visibility was needed at Farms, Gereeld Caravan
Park and Holiday houses as well as the rural areas.
It was suggested that police should
patrol the community areas more often to get a sense of what is happening and what
might happen.
This would also assist them when they see something wrong.
To improve
service delivery it was suggested that better police facilities were needed and that police
needed to deal more quickly and efficiently with cases.
More police were needed and
that the station was in a terrible state where people identified that they had no privacy.
Better communication with the community was also requested while it was suggested that
some police overlook crimes because of being bribed and that they did not trust the
police.
Police should be accountable and gain the respect of the community rather than
being forceful.
4X4 vehicles are needed for access to the beach.
Graafwater suggested that there be more police on duty and that police were more
involved with the day-to -day running of the police station.
More police visibility was needed on the farms and surrounding areas.
Better training was cited as allowing for
better service delivery but there were also comments that members of the community
were happy with the police's performance.
152
At Klawer participants suggested that more police officers were needed at their station
and that better leadership was needed.
The implementation of a neighbourhood watch
was also cited as being a useful measure and that the community needs to work together
with the police.
The N7, national road, farms and tourist travel areas needed more police
visibility.
It was noted that the area that the police station covers is too big and that more
site-specific vehicles were needed.
Lambertsbaai participants mentioned that they needed more officers and that language
and communication with the public was a concern.
It was suggested that the police work
in conjunction with the community such as other law enforcement departments and that
they set up more road blocks, have better visibility and that they don't always wait for
residents to complain before they tackle crime.
One crime, which needs to be addressed,
was crayfish smuggling.
More police need to patrol the harbour as well as Harmony Park,
public areas and the business centre.
Lutzvilles shortage of communication caused by language barriers was perceived as a
problem as well as a shortage of personnel and equipment.
There needs to be more
collaboration and communication between the police and the community.
More visibility
is needed on farms and Ebenezer, Koekenaap, Lutzville, Lutzville-West Uitkyk and that they
set up more road blocks.
More vehicles, police members and equipment for quicker
response time to emergency complaints are needed.
The area that the police station
covers is cited as being too large.
Nuwerus participants cited a shortage of personnel.
It was often mentioned that Kliprand
needs police visibility over weekends, especially on Saturdays.
Collaboration between the
public and the police was suggested as a way to increase police accountability.
Again
distance to the police station was seen as a problem.
The participants at Vanrhynsdorp indicated that more desk operations are required.
It was
suggested that the police have better incentives.
Police should tackle petty crime as they
see it in the street and lead by example.
It was identified that the sector police station was
not functioning properly in Hopland and Maskamsig as well as sector three areas need
more police visibility.
Better communication and stopping drug-related crime and drug
smuggling was suggested as things that the police in this area needed to improve on.
At Vredendal better police communication, language barriers and police friendliness was
suggested as needing attention.
Farms and Sector 1 and Vredendal North need more
visibility as well as the CBD over the weekends.

II) SUITABILITY OF RESOURCES IN ADDRESSING CRIME IN COMMUNITIES
The majority (57%) of respondents of the Vredenburg police cluster felt that the police
resources are not suitable in addressing crime in the community while 43% of respondents
felt that these resources are suitable.
All of the participants in Darling (100%) indicated that their resources are suitable in
addressing crime in their areas.
The areas where the majority of participants indicated the
unsuitability of resources are Saldanha (90%), Laaiplek (88%) and Langebaan (75%).
III) UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES
The majority of participants (68%) indicated that the resources are being effectively utilized
and 32% of participants indicated that the police resources are not being used effectively.
Most of the participants in Redelinghuys (100%), Hopefield (90%), St Helena Bay (89%) and
Laaiplek (88%) indicated that resources are utilized effectively while participants in
Piketberg (67%) and Langebaan (63%) indicated to the contrary.
Just over half of the participants (51%) indicated that there are not enough police officials

The majority (82%) of participants in the Vredenburg police cluster indicated that the
police officials working within the CSC are polite and helpful while18% indicated that the
police officers are neither polite nor helpful at all.
This is despite their perceiving a lack in
both personnel and other resources.
This is an important statistic when considering the
manner in which police services are delivered to the public and in creating a trusting
relationship between the police and the public.
The majority of participants at all police stations agree that the police officers in the CSCs
are helpful to members of the public except in Piketberg where the majority (78%) of
participants indicated that the police officers in the CSC are neither polite nor helpful.
V) SERVICES RENDERED BY THE DETECTIVES
Popular opinion of participants (67%) indicated that they are satisfied with the services
rendered by the detectives whereas 33% are not satisfied with services rendered by
detectives. In the main participants in Redelinghuys (100%), St Helena Bay (100%),
Hopefield (90%) and Darling (80%) indicated that they are satisfied with the services
rendered by the detectives.
However, in Laaiplek (83%), Piketberg (78%) and Langebaan
(75%) dissatisfaction was highlighted.
PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS
155
The majority (52%) of participants think that the witnesses of crimes are protected, while (32%)
indicated that they do not know whether witnesses are protected and 17% thought that the
witnesses are not protected.

the case for Laaiplek (100%), Vredenburg (100%), Darling (80%) and Hopefield (80.
More stop
and search operations were considered by 54% of participants as being useful in increasing police
visibility.
The majority of participants in Laaiplek (100%), Langebaan (78%) and Eendekuil (75%)
were of this opinion.
Full implementation of sector policing was considered by 50% of participants as a means of
improving police visibility.
The majority of participants in Hopefield (100%) and Laaiplek (100%)
suggested the full implementation of sector policing to improve police visibility.
VIII) POLICE RESPONSE TIME TO AN EMERGENCY
To assist in an emergency, the majority (61%) of community members indicated 5-10 minutes as
an appropriate police response time while 28% felt that 10-15 minutes was acceptable as a
response time in the case of an emergency and 11% indicated that 15-20 minutes is acceptable.

he communities of the Western Cape Province have identified five priority crimes that they are
concerned about in their respective areas.
These are assault GBH, sexual offences, common
assault, common robbery and domestic violence.
In addition to the priority crimes identified, the
communities frequently mentioned burglary at residential premises more often than any other crime
categories even though it does not form part of the top priority crimes.
These five identified top
priority crimes can help police with the planning of a crime prevention strategy at provincial and
local level.
The top five priority crimes identified by the local communities are to be included in the provincial
54
of the SAPS for the period 1st April 2011 to 31 March 2012.
operational priorities
This will assist SAPS in deploying resources where they are needed most.
II) SERVICE DELIVERY ISSUES
The service delivery issues related to those services, which are mostly used by the community
members.
This include the suitability of resources in addressing crime, resource utilization,
COMMUNITY SAFETY
159
service rendered at the CSC; services rendered by the detectives; witness protection programme;
police visibility and response time and community-police relations.
In the main the respondents of the Western Cape are of the view that the police resources are not
suitable in addressing crime in their respective communities.
The general perception is that most
police stations have a shortage of police officers and vehicles that result in slow response time
to crime situations.
The CSCs in some stations are reportedly very small and do not allow privacy
to victims of trauma.
In the rural areas the long distance between the communities and police
stations was identified as a major challenge.
This suggests more police officers, vehicles;
equipment should be allocated to police stations to improve service delivery.
More bigger and user-
friendly police stations with cubicles should be built to give privacy to the complainants reporting
cases at the CSCs.
In relation to utilization of resources more than half of the participants indicated that the police
officers utilise the resources effectively.
The key challenge is the limited resources, which cannot
accommodate the needs of the communities.
However, it should be noted that for this area
participants highlighted that some police officers are misusing the limited resources for their
personal use.
As a recommendation, participants request that police officers should be held
accountable for wrong behaviour and that the number of police officers should be increased.
The majority of participants are of the view that there are sufficient police officers deployed at the
Community Service Centre who are helpful and polite to the community members.
A serious
challenge identified at the CSC is the language barrier where the deployed officers at the CSCs
cannot communicate with complainants in their preferred language.
More trained and dedicated
police officers that can communicate with complainants in their home language should be deployed
at the CSCs.
Training on communication, statement taking and computers are recommended for
the police officers working at the CSCs to enable them to treat community members with respect.
More than half of the participants indicated that they are satisfied with services offered by
detectives.
In general participants are of the view is that with the limited resources detectives are
doing their level best.
Some of the challenges identified by the participants are the shortage of
skilled detectives that result in improper investigations; shortage of feedback provided to
complainants and long time frames spent on investigating cases as major challenges affecting
the services delivered by the detectives.
These challenges suggest that more skilled detectives should be recruited to decrease the case
loads of detectives.
In addition more resources should be provided to detectives.
In relation to the witness protection programme the majority communities indicated that they do not
know whether witnesses of crime are protected.
This may suggest that the witnesses of crime are
not safe which may result in underreporting of crime.
Witnesses may not speak up when they
witness crime, which may affect the prosecution of perpetrators.
To improve the witness protection
programme, the participants recommend that education of community members about this
programme, anti-corruption measures and follow ups with witnesses of crime should be conducted.
To improve police visibility in areas the majority of participants proposed that more police patrols
during the day and night should be conducted.
However, it should be noted that most
participants are of the view that foot patrols would be more effective than police vehicles.
This suggests that more stop and search operations should be conducted in the areas.
Another
recommendation made is the full implementation of sector policing in the communities.
The majority of participants agree that the police should respond to a crime situation between 5 to
10 minutes, as this will increase the chances of gathering evidence.
Through police visibility and
patrols and increased police vehicles the police response time to crime situations could be
improved.
stations.
This suggests that most police Station Commanders do not allow CPFs to provide input.
This also suggests that the Station Commissioners of the areas should be sensitised to involve the
CPFs in the development of station plans and resource allocation.
III) SUBSTANCE ABUSE
Another important aspect that is a major contributor of crime researched during the study is that of substance abuse.
The majority (88%) of communities acknowledged that substance abuse is a
challenge in their areas.
There is a negative perception that most police officers are being bribed
by the shebeen owners and drug lords.
The communities recommend that a specialised unit should
be established to deal with the substance abuse problem.
Furthermore, more police raids should
be conducted in partnership with the community structures (CPF, NHWes), municipalities to ensure
transparency by the police.
4.12 CONCLUSION
The SAPS operational priorities should be in line with the identified PNPs of the communities.
The
SAPS operational categories are too broad and do not specify which specific types will be
prioritized.
The research reveals that the resources at most of the police stations are not suitable in
addressing crime in communities.
Most police stations experience a shortage of resources such as
personnel, vehicles and police stations (in the rural areas).
A shortage of police visibility in the communities due to limited resources has been identified.
There is a need to deploy more competent and dedicated police officers at the CSCs who can
communicate with the communities in their home language, this should be prioritized as it affects
service delivery at police stations.
The communities are not confident in the witness protection programme.
The Criminal Justice
System should conduct education sessions to community members to help communities
understanding of this programme.
The image if the police service needs to be transformed.
The police officers should be dedicated
and treat people with respect in their respective police stations.
The police should not work in
isolation in the fight against crime.
Partnerships with other law enforcement agencies, community
structures, business sectors etc should be established.
4.13 RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the afore-mentioned findings, a number of recommendations are made to the
Department:
W) That the findings of this report be incorporated in the Provincial and local SAPS annual plans
for the 2011/12 financial year.
X) That Community Police Forums be assisted to develop indicators to monitor police
performance at local police precinct level.
Y) That SAPS develop a strategy to address the problem of weapons and sharp objects since
these have been utilized in committing priority offences such as assault GBH.
Z) Promoting and raising awareness within communities about
the Witness Protection
Programmes to encourage community members to testify in the prosecution of criminals.
AA) The training and development of skills of detectives need to continue, especially in respect
of investigating crimes such as domestic violence and sexual offences.
BB) Enhance skills of detectives for improved evidence collection and recording and the
processing of evidence in order to build strong and prosecutable cases.
This will increase the
number of cases brought before court and the conviction rate in respect thereof.
CC) That sector policing be adequately resourced and promoted and receives the necessary
support in order to improve response times and to promote police visibility.
DD) That Station Commanders be sensitised in respect of the need for CPFs to be engaged for
input into the station and resource utilization plans of respective police stations.
EE) An illegal drug supply reduction strategy should be developed and implemented by SAPS
with the assistance of other partners.
FF) The role of organized crime syndicates and gangs as drivers of crime, more especially crime
involving drug abuse and violence within the Western Cape Province, cannot be
underestimated.
Accordingly it is necessary for all policing agencies to focus on how best to
neutralize and or mitigate the impact of organised crime and gangs.
REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF POLICING NEEDS AND PRIORITIES IN THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE (2010/11)
3.5 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
The study is limited to the Policing Needs and Priorities of the fully-fledged police stations in the
province.
It therefore does not consider the differences that may exist within the different sectors in
a policing precinct.
Although the CPF structures are legally the representatives of the community,
to identify the PNPs, the focus groups were not always representative of the whole community.
The relationship between the CPF structure and the SAPS management may also influence the
responses provided.
A close relationship may indicate positive responses while a bad relationship
may illicit negative responses.
In order to counter the above-mentioned limitations the findings,
where possible, were triangulated with other studies.
One of the main foci of this report is to influence the SAPS annual plan.
A detail study of this nature
needs more time and a much bigger budget.
Although the report commended on policing needs
and priorities up to local police station level, value of the report is applicable to the broad themes
that it presents.

Q1.
PRIORITY CRIMES
Q 1.1.

Health infrastructure delivery
The Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works delivers
infrastructure and services to people of the province to promote positive socio-
economic outcome and safe, empowered and connected communities.
The construction of a R24 million Western Cape Department of Health clinic in Napier to replace existing facilities has commenced.
Commissioned by the Department of Transport and
Public Works, the clinic is expected to have been completed by the end of 2017.
Once it is open, the new Napier Clinic will provide a range of primary healthcare (PHC) services including womens health, child health, mental health, oral health and rehabilitation
services, as well as infectious disease treatment, and curative and chronic care.
The facility will be easily accessible to people with disabilities.
Features include separate consultation rooms, wound care and treatment rooms, as well as areas for the treatment of
infectious diseases.
The clinic will also have a covered outdoor waiting area with built-in seating as well as a play area for children.
The indoor waiting area will have an open plan design that includes a pharmacy area, reception area, help desk, and administration offices.
The people of the town have always been active in seeking quality PHC services.
Forty years ago, a mobile service visited once a week.
By 2003, the needs had grown so much that the Napier Clinic was established.
It soon became apparent that the clinic was too small to offer adequate healthcare services that respected the needs and privacy of all its clients. When
the Department of Health took over the clinic in 2006, it procured two prefabricated structures to alleviate the pressure.
The population of the town has tripled over the last 30 years, and there has been a steady increase in its primary healthcare needs.
The new Napier Clinic will meet current needs, and it
has been designed in such a way that it can easily be extended to keep pace with the future needs of the local community.
We lead in the delivery of government infrastructure and related services Better tOGetHer.

FOREWORD BY THE CHAIRPERSON
The advent of the second decade of our democracy is an opportune time to reflect
on our commitment to language rights.
Of the many gifts brought to us through our
struggle and new Constitution, one of the most precious is the guarantee of
language rights.
There is little closer to an individual than the beauty of his or her
mother tongue.
By forming the dignity and identity of the person, the phrases and
music of the mother tongue lies at the core of a persons being.
The Western Cape
Language Committees mission over the past year, together with activities to
promote language, literacy and Sign Language programmes in disadvantaged
communities, bears testimony to our commitment to ensuring the equal status of the
three official languages of the province  Afrikaans, English and isiXhosa.
It was also
heartening that a member representing the Sign Language community, Ms Mirriam
Ganiso, joined the committee during the year under review.
Prof. Rajendra
Chetty
Linguistic human rights are aimed at the promotion of linguistic justice and the removal or prevention of
linguistic inequalities that may occur because of language.
The benefits gained from the
implementation of these rights include the right to individual and collective identity.
Linguistic rights also
include the right to learn other languages including the official languages that are used in a particular
area so that the individual can participate in social, political and economic processes.
The progressive
nature of the legislative and policy frameworks have created space for the practice of linguistic human
rights.
However, resources should also be provided to ensure the implementation of the policy.
The Language-in-Education Policy (1997) aimed to provide a framework to enable schools to formulate
appropriate school language policies that align with the principle of language rights and to maintain
home languages while providing access to the effective acquisition of additional languages and to
promote multilingualism.
The practical implementation of this policy continues to be fraught with
challenges and still leaves marginalised languages out in the cold when it comes to the choice of the
language of learning and teaching.
While enabling policies are in place, society must remain vigilant
to ensure that the policies are implemented and that multilingualism is promoted.
It is heartening to
note that the Department of Basic Education is phasing in an African language as an additional
language subject in all South African schools.
As of 2014, a sample of 10 schools in each province will
offer an African language. Hopefully, this vision will enhance and support the expectation of superior
results in literacy in the public school system.
The Western Cape Language Committee notes with gratitude the good work accomplished over the
past year by the Language Services component of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport.
The
Language Services component strives to give effect to the Western Cape Language Policy through the
activities of the Translating, Editing and Interpreting Unit and the Language Policy Implementation Unit.
This component tries to ensure that residents of the Western Cape have access to services in the official
language of their choice.
It also promotes previously marginalised languages and South African Sign
Language through awareness programmes and activities to enhance their development.
The Committee notes with appreciation the generous support over the past year of Minister of Cultural
Affairs and Sport Dr Ivan Meyer.
The Language Committee was able to meet its objectives and achieve
success in its programmes and deliberations through the dedication and collegiality of the members of
the Committee.
I sincerely thank my colleagues in the Committee for the role they have played over
the past year in upholding our commitment to social inclusion and language rights for all in our province.
To have another language is to possess a second soul.

4 ACCOUNTING AUTHORITYS OVERVIEW
Although the vacancy for a representative for the Deaf community on the
Language Committee was filled when Ms M Ganiso was appointed on 21 May 2013,
the appointed member resigned on 27 January 2014 because of study
commitments in another province.
The Standing Committee of the Western Cape
Provincial Parliament has since advertised the vacancy with the intention of sending
the names to the MEC for appointment as soon as possible.
In order to promote multilingualism, the Language Committee decided to partner
with PRAESA (the Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa) in a
project called Nalibali.
This project develops childrens potential through storytelling
and reading in a language they understand.
The Language Committee is assisting
by advising on, translating and editing some of the texts for the multilingual
pamphlets that are distributed throughout the province.
Jane Moleleki
The Language Committee will also monitor the implementation of the Language Policy in the various
government departments and plans to focus on the Department of the Premier in the 2014/15 financial year.

STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AND CONFIRMATION OF ACCURACY OF THE ANNUAL
REPORT To the best of my knowledge and belief, I confirm the following:
Financial Statements audited by the Auditor-General.
The Annual Report is complete, accurate and is free from any omissions.
The Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines on the annual report
as issued by National Treasury.
The Annual Financial Statements (Part E) have been prepared in accordance with the GRAP
standards applicable to the Western Cape Language Committee.
The Accounting Authority is responsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements
and for the judgements made in this information.
The Accounting Authority is responsible for establishing, and implementing a system of internal
control that has been designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the integrity and
reliability of the performance information, the human resources information and the Annual
Financial Statements.
The external auditors are engaged to express an independent opinion on the Annual Financial
Statements.
In my opinion, this Annual Report fairly reflects the operations, the performance information, the human
resources information and the financial affairs of the Western Cape Language Committee for the
financial year ended 31 March 2014.

SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS
2.1
Service delivery environment
A list of isiXhosa terms for the use of the Western Cape Government was finalised at a terminology
verification workshop in Cape Town on 11 and 12 April 2013. The meeting was jointly organised by the
Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport and the Western Cape Language Committee.
An isiXhosa-
English terminology booklet was produced for the use of all Western Cape language practitioners.
The WCLC administered a survey questionnaire to assess the implementation of the Language Policy in
the provincial Department of Community Safety and the provincial Department of Social
Development.
The report on the survey findings was compiled in-house and the Analysis and Research
sub-committee accepted the report.
The WCLC has a mandate to discuss language-related matters and provide advice to PanSALB and
the MEC. To that end, plenary meetings took place on 15 May, 14 August, 13 November 2013 and 12
February 2014.
The Executive Committee met on 22 August and 13 December 2013.
The Analysis and
Research sub-committee met on 9 October 2013.
PanSALB has a mandate to develop, monitor and promote the use of official languages within the
provinces in South Africa.
A draft memorandum of understanding was prepared between the WCLC,
DCAS and PanSALB to serve as a framework for PanSALB to provide financial support for relevant WCLC
activities in the Western Cape.
The draft agreement has been submitted to PanSALB head office.
The WCLCs multilingualism campaign took the form of advising on, translating and editing some of the
texts for the multilingual Nalibali pamphlets that are distributed throughout the province.
2.2 Organisational environment
During the year under review, the WCLCs South African Sign Language representative Mirriam Ganiso
resigned to pursue studies in another province.
This left a gap in the Committees activities because,
during the duration of her service, she played a critical role advising and supporting all SASL-related
projects.
An advertisement was placed for a new SASL representative and the process is expected to
be finalised in the 2014/15 financial year.
2.3
Key policy developments and legislative changes
Two new national language-related Acts have been signed by the President.
The Use of Official Languages Act, 2012 (Act 12 of 2012) which requires all national government
departments, national public entities and national state-owned enterprises to choose three
official languages in their communication with the public and to make provision for the other
official languages and South African Sign Language.
The South African Language Practitioners Council Act, 2014 (Act 8 of 2014), which establishes
a juristic person to regulate language practice and to control the accreditation and
registration of language practitioners.

PART C: GOVERNANCE
INTRODUCTION
Corporate governance embodies processes and systems by which public entities are directed,
controlled and held to account.
In addition to legislative requirements based on a public entitys
enabling legislation, corporate governance with regard to public entities is applied through the
precepts of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), National Treasury Regulations and Provincial
Treasury Instructions in tandem with the principles contained in the King Report on Corporate
Governance, 2009 (King III).
Parliament, the Executive and the Accounting Authority of the public entity are responsible for
corporate governance.

RISK MANAGEMENT
The Accounting Authority (AA) for the Western Cape Language Committee (WCLC),takes responsibility
for implementing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) in accordance with the National Treasury Public
Sector Risk Management Framework (NTPSRMF) and the Directorate Enterprise Risk Management
(D:ERM) in the Entity of the Premier (DoTP) provides a centralised strategic support service to the Entity.
15
In compliance with the National Treasury Public Sector Risk Management Framework (NTPSRMF) and to
further embed risk management within the Entity, the Western Cape Government (WCG) has adopted
an ERM Policy which sets out the WCGs overall intention with regard to ERM.
An Annual ERM Implementation Strategy has been developed in order to give effect to the WCG ERM
policy and to attain the Annual ERM Implementation Plan and the risk management priorities of the
Entity. This enables the Entity to deliver on its goals, objectives and key performance indicators,
enhance risk informed decision making and optimise compliance with applicable legislation.
It further
outlines the roles and responsibilities of managers and staff in embedding risk management in the Entity
and defines the enabling legislation, standards, mechanisms, tools and resources to be used to realise
the ERM plan.
The Fraud and Risk Management Committee (FARMCO) provides governance oversight over the entire
system of risk management of the Entity and furnishes the Accounting Authority with the requisite
reports in respect of performance of risk management.
The Audit Committee provides the independent
oversight of the Entitys system of risk management.
The Audit Committee is furnished with Quarterly
ERM progress reports and the Entities risk profiles and registers to execute their independent oversight
role.
The Audit Committees evaluation of the risk management process is in relation to the progress of
implementation of the Entities Annual ERM Implementation Plan and significant/strategic risks faced by
the Entity and their relevant risk response/treatment strategies.
Fraud and Risk Management Committee
The Entity has established a FARMCO to assist the Accounting Authority in executing her respective
responsibilities concerned with risk management.
The committee operates under a terms of reference
approved by the Accounting Officer.
The Committee comprises of select members of the Entitys
senior management team.
As per its terms of reference the Committee should meet four times a year.

managed by allocated risk owners.
Programme risk registers are approved by the relevant programme
manager. The Fraud and Risk Management Committee ratifies, prioritises and further recommends to the
Accounting Authority which significant risks have been mitigated with an appropriate risk response/
treatment in order to meet the entitys strategic objectives.
This process is conducted quarterly and
feeds into the evaluation of the performance environment of the entity.
WESTERN CAPE LANGUAGE COMMITTEE  ANNUAL REPORT 2013/14 16
INTERNAL CONTROL UNIT
It is the responsibility of the Accounting Authority to continually assess and evaluate internal controls to
assure that the control activities in place are effective, efficient and transparent and updated when
necessary.
To achieve this, quarterly key control meetings were held with the Auditor-General,
programme managers of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport and the MEC.
This is an ongoing
process to ensure that the Department obtains clean audits.
INTERNAL AUDIT AND AUDIT COMMITTEES
Internal Audit provides management with independent, objective assurance and consulting services
designed to add value and to continuously improve the operations of the Entity. It should assist the
Entity to accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and

FRAUD AND CORRUPTION
The Western Cape Government adopted an Anti-Corruption Strategy which confirms the Provinces
zero tolerance stance towards fraud and corruption.
The Entity has an approved Fraud Prevention Plan
and a Fraud Prevention Implementation plan which gives effect to the Fraud Prevention Plan.
Various channels for reporting allegations of fraud and corruption exist and these are described in
detail in the Provincial Anti-Corruption Strategy and the Entities Fraud Prevention Plan.
Each allegation
received by the Forensic Investigation Unit is recorded in a Case Management System which is used as
a management tool to report on progress made with cases relating to the Entity and generating
statistics for the Province and the Entity.
We protect employees who blow the whistle on suspicions of
fraud, corruption and theft if the disclosure is a protected disclosure (i.e. not malicious).
to remain anonymous is afforded to any person who would like to report acts of fraud, theft and
corruption and should they do so in person, their identities are kept confidential by the person to whom
they are reporting.
Once fraud or corruption is confirmed after completion of an investigation, the relevant employee who
participated in these acts is subjected to a disciplinary hearing.
In all such instances, the WCG
representative initiating the disciplinary proceedings is required to recommend dismissal of the
employee concerned.
Where prima facie evidence of criminal conduct is detected, a criminal matter
is reported at the South African Police Services.
During this financial year, 1 investigation was completed by the Forensic Investigation Unit confirming
Fraud or Corruption.
At the end of the financial year, 2 matters remained on the case list of the Entity.
10 MINIMISING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
WCLC ensures that there are no conflicts of interest by insisting that a Declaration of Interest (WCBD4
is obtained from every supplier not registered on the Western Cape Supplier Database.
Before
doing business with suppliers who are registered on the database, checks are done to verify that their
WCBD4 declarations are not more than 12 months old.
Provincial Treasury is assisting entities to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest where owners or directors
of companies are also public servants in the Western Cape.
This is done by providing information from
PERSAL (the Personnel Salary System) about public servants who are registered as owners or directors of
companies.
The entity ensures that such persons possess a Remunerative Work Outside the Public
Service (RWOPS) approval letter before doing business with them.
The entity has not found any conflict of interest with any business concluded with suppliers. If such a
conflict were to be discovered, the matter will be treated as a fraudulent Supply Chain Management
activity and, after a due diligence investigation, the supplier will be identified as a non-preferred
service provider.
11 CODE OF CONDUCT
The policy implemented by DCAS incorporates the WCLC.
The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to
promote a high standard of professional ethics in the workplace.
WCLC strives to adhere and comply
with the content of the Code.
Employees are made aware of the content of the Code of Conduct
through, among other things, the compulsory induction of all newly appointed employees.
The Code
was distributed to all employees as a reminder to continue promoting high standards of professional
ethics in the workplace.
If and when the content of the code is breached, managers make use of progressive discipline as necessary.
More serious offences are referred to the Corporate Services Centre
(Directorate Employee Relations) for formal disciplinary procedures.
12 HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
The policy as implemented by DCAS incorporates the WCLC.
Health and safety issues are addressed by
conducting monthly inspections at DCAS Head Office and annual audit inspections at all other offices of the Department.
Contingency plans and business continuity plans have been compiled for all the
offices. The managers at all offices have been appointed as health and safety risk coordinators, safety
marshalls, first aiders and fire-fighters and trained.
Annual fire drills are conducted at offices in the Cape Town city centre in collaboration with the
Department of Community Safety and the Disaster Risk Management Department of the City of Cape
Town which monitor and provide comment in respect of all processes.
Occupational health and safety meetings are held quarterly at top management level to discuss
health, safety and environmental issues.
The holding of annual health and safety awareness programmes has considerably raised the level of
awareness in the entity.
The entity has implemented a waste management programme.
Waste paper is
collected and disposed of every month.

PART D: HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
The Western Cape Language Committee was appointed on 1 September 2012 for a three-year term.
The Western Cape Provincial Languages Act, 1998 makes provision for eleven members.
However, only
ten members were appointed because no nominations for South African Sign Language
representatives were received.
An advertisement was placed again for the nomination of a Sign
Language representative and the appointment is expected soon.
The language interests of the Western Cape are represented in the following way:
isiXhosa is represented by two members;
English is represented by two members; and
Previously marginalised and indigenous languages are represented by one member.
Once the outstanding post is filled, SASL will be represented by one member.
2 HUMAN RESOURCE OVERSIGHT STATISTICS
These statistics are reported in the Annual Report of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport.
PART E: FINANCIAL INFORMATION
REPORT OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL TO THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCIAL PARLIAMENT ON
THE WESTERN CAPE LANGUAGE COMMITTEE
REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Introduction
1.
I have audited the financial statements of the Western Cape Language Committee set
out on pages 25 to 40, which comprise the statement of financial position as at
31 March 2014, the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net
assets, the cash flow statement and the statement of comparison of budget and actual
amounts for the year then ended, as well as the notes, comprising a summary of
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Accounting authoritys responsibility for the financial statements
2.
The accounting authority is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
financial statements in accordance with the South African Standards of Generally
Recognised Accounting Practice (SA Standards of GRAP), the requirements of the
Public Finance Management Act of South Africa, 1999 (Act No. 1 of 1999) (PFMA) and
section 19(5) of the Western Cape Provincial Languages Act, 1998 (Act No. 13 of 1998)
(WCPLA), and for such internal control as the accounting authority determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor-generals responsibility
3.
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my
audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the Public Audit Act of South Africa,
2004 (Act No. 25 of 2004) (PAA), the general notice issued in terms thereof and
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that I comply with ethical
requirements, and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
4.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the
auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements.
5.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for my audit opinion.
Opinion
6.
In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Western Cape Language Committee as at 31 March 2014, and
22
Standards of GRAP and the requirements of the PFMA and the WCPLA.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
7.
In accordance with the PAA and the general notice issued in terms thereof, I report the
following findings on the reported performance information against predetermined
objectives for selected objectives presented in the annual performance report, non-
compliance with legislation as well as internal control.
The objective of my tests was to
identify reportable findings as described under each subheading but not to gather
evidence to express assurance on these matters. Accordingly, I do not express an
opinion or conclusion on these matters.
Predetermined objectives
8.
I performed procedures to obtain evidence about the usefulness and reliability of the
reported performance information for the following selected objective presented in the
annual performance report of the public entity for the year ended 31 March 2014 :
Monitor and advise on the implementation of the Western Cape Language Policy (on
9.
I evaluated the reported performance information against the overall criteria of
usefulness and reliability.
10.
I evaluated the usefulness of the reported performance information to determine
whether it was presented in accordance with the National Treasurys annual reporting
principles and whether the reported performance was consistent with the planned
objectives.
I further performed tests to determine whether indicators and targets were
well defined, verifiable, specific, measurable, time bound and relevant, as required by
the National Treasurys Framework for managing programme performance information.
11.
I assessed the reliability of the reported performance information to determine whether it
was valid, accurate and complete.
12.
I did not raise any material findings on the usefulness and reliability of the reported
performance information for the selected objective.
Additional matter
13.
Although I raised no material findings on the usefulness and reliability of the reported
performance information for the selected objective, I draw attention to the following
matter: Achievement of planned targets
14.
Refer to the annual performance report on page 9 for information on the achievement of
the planned targets for the year.
Compliance with legislation

I performed procedures to obtain evidence that the entity had complied with applicable
legislation regarding financial matters, financial management and other related matters.
I did not identify any instances of material non-compliance with specific matters in key

Internal control
16.
I considered internal control relevant to my audit of the financial statements, annual
performance report and compliance with legislation.

Description
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GRAP requires management to make judgements,
estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year or in the year of the revision
and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
1.1.2
The cash flow statement can only be prepared in accordance with the direct method.
1.1.3
Specific information has been presented separately on the statement of position such as:
Taxes and transfers payable;
Trade and other payables from non-exchange transactions.

probable that future economic benefits or service potential will flow to the entity and when the amount of revenue
can be reliably measured, and specific criteria have been met for the entitys activities.

The amount is not considered to be reliably measurable until all contingencies relating to the transaction have been resolved.
1.4.1
1.4.1.1 Unconditional grants
An unconditional grant is recognised in revenue when the grant becomes receivable.
1.4.1.2 Conditional grants and receipts
Revenue received from conditional grants, donations and funding are recognised as revenue to the extent that the
entity has complied with any of the criteria, conditions or obligations embodied in the agreement.
To the extent that
the criteria, conditions or obligations have not been met, a liability is recognised.
Interest earned on investments is treated in accordance with grant conditions.
If it is payable to the grantor it is
recorded as part of the liability and if not, it is recognised as interest earned in the statement of financial
performance.
Grants that compensate the entity for expenses incurred are recognised in surplus or deficit on a systematic basis in
the same periods in which the expenses are recognised.
1.4.1.3 Services in-kind
Services in-kind are services provided by individuals to entities, without charge, but may be subject to stipulations.
Public entity staff provide valuable support to the entity in achieving its objectives; however, the service provided
cannot be measured reliably and therefore it is not recognised in the statement of financial performance or
statement of financial position.
The nature of the service is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, related parties.
1.4.2
Revenue received from interest on investments and current bank account.
1.5.

for the year ended 31 March 2014
1.6.2
Fruitless and wasteful expenditure
Fruitless and wasteful expenditure is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position until such time as the
expenditure is recovered from the responsible person or written off as irrecoverable in the statement of financial
performance.
1.6.3
Irregular expenditure

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The financial instruments of the entity are categorised as either financial assets or liabilities.
1.7.1
Financial assets
A financial asset is any asset that is cash or a contractual right to receive cash.
The entity has the following types of
financial assets as reflected on the face of the statement of financial position or in the notes thereto:
Cash and cash equivalents
In accordance with GRAP 104, the financial assets of the entity are classified as follows into the categories allowed by
this standard:
Type of financial Asset
Categorised in terms of GRAP 104
Loans and receivables
1.7.1.1 Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at cost which represents fair value.
After initial recognition, financial
assets are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method less an allowance for impairment.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months, which are classified as non-current
assets.
1.7.2
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity. The financial
liabilities of the entity are trade and other payables as reflected on the face of the statement of financial position and
the notes thereto.
34
There are two main categories of financial liabilities, the classification based on how they are measured. Financial
liabilities may be measured at:
Fair value through surplus or deficit; or
Amortised cost
Financial liabilities that are measured at fair value through surplus or deficit are stated at fair value, with any resulted
gain or loss recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Any other financial liability should be classified as
financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through surplus or deficit and are initially measured at fair value,
net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
1.8.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The entity makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by
definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
1.8.1
Provision for impairment of receivables
An estimate for the impairment of receivables is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
The
provision for impairment debt shall be calculated on trade receivables only.
The total impairment provision of the
entity shall be calculated either by individual debtor or at least per risk category.
1.9.
VAT & POSSIBLE EXEMPTIONS
The entity is exempt from VAT registration.
However, if any funding is received that requires the entity to register as a
VAT Vendor, such application will be lodged.
35
Cash and cash equivalents consist of:
Bank balance
Credit quality of cash at bank and short term deposits, excluding cash on hand
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term, highly liquid investments that are held with registered
banking institutions with maturities of three months or less and that are subject to insignificant interest rate risk, the
carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Trade payables
Trade and other payables are classified as a financial liability.
The carrying amount of trade and other payables
transactions approximate their fair value.

The entitys activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest

WESTERN CAPE LANGUAGE COMMITTEE
NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
In terms of i ts
borrowing requirements, the entity ensures that adequate funds are available to meet its expected and unexpected
financial commitments.
All outstanding accounts payable balances are due within 30 days of the reporting date.
Sensitivity analysis
At 31 March 2014, if the interest rates on variable rate financial instruments had been 1% higher/lower with all other
variables held constant, post tax profit for the year would have been R2,270 higher/lower.
Interest rate risk
The entitys risk profile consists of fixed and floating rate loans and bank balances which exposes the entity to fair
value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk and can be summarized as follows:
Financial Assets
Trade and other receivables are at a fixed rate.
Management manages interest rate risk by negotiating beneficial
rates on floating rate loans and where possible using fixed rate loans.
Management also has a policy balancing the interest on asset loans with the interest payable on liabilities.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to
the entity.
The entity has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy parties.
Credit risk consists mainly of cash deposits, cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and trade debtors.
The
entity only deposits cash with major banks with high quality credit standing and limits exposure to any one counter-
party.

Take your son to the doctor for medical examination to check whether he is  t to undergo the ritual.
The
medial doctor must issue you a certi cate of  tness that you will produce to the initiation forum and the
surgeon (iNgcibi).
Please note, no circumcision procedure shall take place without this certi cate.
Ask the respective initiation forum to recommend an experienced (iNgcibi) and the carer (iKhankatha) or
introduce your preferred one to the initiation forum.
You must make sure that your iNgcibi and iKhankatha
meet and exchange points of clarity and procedures to each other.
Initiates food must always come from home.

BE PROUD.
BE THERE FOR YOUR SON TILL THE END.
DONT LEAVE HIM IN THE HANDS OF STRANGERS.
LET YOUR SON LEAVE THE INITIATION SCHOOL ONLY WHEN HE IS READY!!!
It is anticipated that the current winter season will be extremely cold compared to previous ones due to the
waging drought.
Therefore parents are being cautioned and asked to make the necessary preparations, and if
they will not be able to endure such extra preparations they are advised to rather look at the next season !!!!

INTRODUCTION
The current constitutional dispensation in South Africa makes provision
for the right of access to any information held by the State (subject to
and to information held by a private body that is
required for the exercise or protection of any right.
The Constitutional Court interpreted the right of access to information
as not merely a right to obtain access to information for the exercise or
protection of a right, but also to ensure that there is open and
accountable administration at all levels of government.
Section 32(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution of the Republic of South
Africa, 1996 (the Constitution) reads as flows:
(1) Everyone has the right of access to
any information held by the State; and
any information that is held by another person and
that is required for the exercise or protection of any
rights.
National legislation must be enacted to give effect to this
right, and may provide for reasonable measures to
alleviate the administrative and financial burden on the
state..
The aforesaid resulted in the enactment of the Promotion of Access to
Information Act, 2000 (PAIA).
The purpose of PAIA is to foster a culture
of transparency and accountability in public and private bodies and to
empower and educate the people of South Africa to understand their
rights. 3
In terms of section 14 of PAIA a public body must have a manual which sets
out amongst others the functions of, and an index of records held by a public
body.
This manual gives effect to the provisions of section 14 of PAIA and
also provides assistance on the procedure that must be followed to request
access to a record that is being held by the Department of Community Safety. 4

FOREWORD BY THE CHAIRPERSON
As reported last year, the Western Cape Cultural Commission (WCCC) has
embraced the vision of the member of the Provincial Executive Committee
(MEC) for Cultural Affairs and Sport, Dr Ivan Meyer, of promoting cultural warmth
among the various cultural communities of the Western Cape.
Mr Mervyn Smith
We have fully committed ourselves to this work and do it through three subcommittees.
The Commission has been professionally and ably supported by all the staff members of the
Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport (DCAS) who are tasked with assisting and working with us.
Our sincere thanks to Ms Jane Moleleki, Ms Nerine Jeaven and the WCCCs secretary, Mr Clement Williams.
With the assistance of DCAS, the Research and Analysis committee designed a medium-term project
focusing on rites of passage, to be phased in using different genres.
The Department commissioned the
Baxter Theatre and the Magnet Theatre to develop Passage, a well-received drama about what it
means to be a good man in todays world. The production was performed at the Baxter and other
venues.
The play challenges audience members to think critically about a variety of important issues
and to reconsider misconceptions they may be holding.
After visiting the seven cultural facilities for which the WCCC is responsible, the Cultural Facilities
committee noted that the facilities located in rural areas (Koekenaap and Schoemanspoort) are
underutilised.
Workshops were held with surrounding communities to stimulate their interest and to
gather their views on how to these facilities could be more fully utilised.
Moreover, the interaction
helped to forge relations and mutual understanding between the Commission and the communities it serves.
All registered cultural councils who applied for funding received financial assistance to organise events
and conferences.
Three commission members have resigned, so we have to make do with the
minimum number.
I extend the thanks of the Commission to Dr Ivan Meyer, whose call for the commission to create
cultural warmth in the Western Cape forms a key part of our overall goal.
In spite of the challenges we face, the Commission and the Department have worked together as a
team dedicated towards realising our shared mandate.

WESTERN CAPE CULTURAL COMMISSION  ANNUAL REPORT 2013/14
4 ACCOUNTING AUTHORITYS OVERVIEW
The work of the Western Cape Cultural Commission for the 2013/14 financial year
was premised on a participatory approach to ensure the initiatives remain relevant
within the changing environment.
The WCCC is committed to improving service
delivery in arts and culture by ensuring optimal allocation and utilisation of available
resources.
In line with its mandate, the WCCC is responsible for the management of
the cultural facilities placed under its supervision by the MEC, including making
Jane Moleleki
standards and be made accessible to all the communities of the Western Cape.
The maintenance and operational expenditure of the facilities exceeds the income they are able to
generate.
During the year under review, interactive sessions took place with rural communities to seek ways of
ensuring that the facilities are optimally utilised.
An interactive session was also held with traditional/
cultural community leaders to improve relationships with key stakeholders to advance the preservation,
promotion and development of culture in the province.
In 2013/14, seven community cultural councils received funding from the WCCC to fund their projects,
conferences and research.
Because it is committed to enhancing social inclusion, the WCCC constantly reviews its policies and
operations.
A challenge in this regard is that no members of the Commission represent the Central
Karoo, Overstrand or West Coast districts.
Most members live in the City of Cape Town metropolitan
district. DCAS is also unsure about whether the members of the WCCC adequately represent the
In spite of present challenges, the Commission is determined to deliver services which are relevant and
in keeping with meeting the needs and demands of communities in the Western Cape.

The Accounting Authority is responsible for establishing, and implementing a system of internal
control that has been designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the integrity and
reliability of the performance information, the human resources information and the Annual
Financial Statements.
The external auditors are engaged to express an independent opinion on the Annual Financial
Statements.
In our opinion, this Annual Report fairly reflects the operations, the performance information, the human
resources information and the financial affairs of the Western Cape Cultural Commission for the
financial year ended 31 March 2014.
Yours faithfully
Accounting Authority:

PART B: PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
1 AUDITORS REPORT: PREDETERMINED OBJECTIVES
The Auditor-General of South Africa currently performs the necessary audit procedures on the
performance information to provide reasonable assurance in the form of an audit conclusion. The audit
conclusion on the performance against predetermined objectives is included in the report to
management, with material findings being reported under the Predetermined Objectives heading in
the Report on other legal and regulatory requirements section of the auditors report.
Refer to page 30 of the Auditors Report, published as Part E: Financial Information.
SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS
Service delivery environment
The WCCC is committed to the preservation, promotion and development of arts and culture in
the Western Cape.
To achieving this end, the Commission embarked on a process to improve
communication between itself and community organisations in order to ensure more effective
service delivery. During the year under review, the Commission introduced a new focus in line with the
recognition of the need for research-based programming and linking this with DCAS initiatives.
The current situation in respect of the utilisation of the seven cultural facilities reflects is that there
is a high demand for most of the cultural facilities in the City of Cape Town metropolitan district
whilst those in the rural areas are underutilised. This is to be addressed in the 2014/15 financial
year.
A total of 23 applications were received for the registration of new cultural councils.
The
applications were noted by the WCCC but these could not be processed because the MEC had
placed a moratorium on the registration of new cultural councils.
There are 24 registered cultural councils.
The list is dominated by organisations from the Khoisan culture, meaning that other
cultures are under-represented.
Registered cultural councils may apply for financial support to
fund their cultural projects, conferences and research.
So far only a few benefit from the
financial assistance on offer because most cultural councils did not apply for funding in the year
under review.
The WCCC will address this issue during the 2014/15 financial year.
2.2 Organisational environment
The organisational environment has steered the WCCC to adopt a wider view of arts and culture
in order to have a better impact on communities.
This has necessitated that the Commission
goes beyond an operational task focus through strategic planning which has clear objectives
and deliverables.
Consultation takes place on projects before they are implemented.
With the assistance of DCAS, the WCCC commissioned the Baxter Theatre and the Magnet
Theatre to develop a play to assist members of the public to better understand initiation rites of
passage.
The play Passage was staged in Robertson and in various parts of the Metro, including the Baxter Theatre.
10 During the year under review, three members of the WCCC resigned for personal reasons.
A request for new members to be appointed was sent to the MEC.
Key policy developments and legislative changes
Changes in the environment necessitated a review of the implementation of operational policy
frameworks to advance service delivery within communities.
Community workshops were
successfully held to engage communities on aspects of WCCC service delivery.
Strategic outcome-oriented goals
The promotion, development and transformation of cultural activities in the Western Cape
through: encouraging more diverse groups to utilise WCCC facilities;
facilitating cultural warmth through the registration of diverse cultural councils; and
ensuring socially inclusive programmes.
Strategic Outcome-Orientated Goal 1
Fully functional, safe and accessible facilities. Goal Statement
To ensure access, consistent maintenance and utilisation of the
facilities.
Strategic Outcome-Orientated Goal 2 Promoting social dialogue and appreciation amongst diverse cultural
councils/ groups.

RISK MANAGEMENT
The Accounting Authority (AO) for the Western Cape Cultural Commission (WCCC), takes responsibility
for implementing Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) in accordance with the National Treasury Public
Sector Risk Management Framework (NTPSRMF) and the Directorate Enterprise Risk Management
(D:ERM) in the Department of the Premier (DoTP) provides a centralised strategic support service to the
Entity. In compliance with the National Treasury Public Sector Risk Management Framework (NTPSRMF)
WESTERN CAPE CULTURAL COMMISSION  ANNUAL REPORT 2013/14 20
and to further embed risk management within the Entity, the Western Cape Government (WCG) has
adopted an ERM Policy which sets out the WCGs overall intention with regard to ERM.
An Annual ERM Implementation Strategy has been developed in order to give effect to the WCG ERM
policy and to attain the Annual ERM Implementation Plan and the risk management priorities of the
Entity. This enables the Entity to deliver on its goals, objectives and key performance indicators,
enhance risk informed decision making and optimise compliance with applicable legislation.
It further
outlines the roles and responsibilities of managers and staff in embedding risk management in the Entity
and defines the enabling legislation, standards, mechanisms, tools and resources to be used to realise
the ERM plan.
The Fraud and Risk Management Committee (FARMCO) provides governance oversight over the entire
system of risk management of the Entity and furnishes the Accounting Authority with the requisite
reports in respect of performance of risk management.
The Audit Committee provides the independent
oversight of the Entitys system of risk management.
The Audit Committee is furnished with Quarterly
ERM progress reports and the Entities risk profiles and registers to execute their independent oversight
role.
The Audit Committees evaluation of the risk management process is in relation to the progress of
implementation of the Entities Annual ERM Implementation Plan and significant/strategic risks faced by
the Entity and their relevant risk response/treatment strategies.
Fraud and Risk Management Committee (FARMCO)
The Entity has established a FARMCO to assist the Accounting Authority in executing his respective
responsibilities concerned with risk management.
The committee operates under a terms of reference
approved by the Accounting Authority.
The Committee comprises of select members of the Entitys
senior management team.
As per its terms of reference the Committee should meet four times a year.

21 Risk management process
During the period under review, the Entity assessed its risks relative to its strategic and annual performance plan.
Risk assessments are conducted on a strategic level on an annual basis and
updated quarterly.
At a programme level the risk assessments are conducted on a quarterly basis in
order to review and update the existing risks and to identify emerging risks.
Significant risks relevant to
objectives were assessed in terms of its likelihood and impact; risk treatment plans are developed and
managed by allocated risk owners.
Programme risk registers are approved by the respective programme manager.
The FARMCO ratifies, prioritises and further recommends to the Accounting Authority, which significant
risks are mitigated with an appropriate risk response/treatment in order to meet the Entities strategic
objectives.
This process is conducted on a quarterly basis and feeds into the evaluation of the
performance environment of the Entity.
INTERNAL CONTROL UNIT
It is the responsibility of the Accounting Authority to continually assess and evaluate internal
controls to assure that the control activities in place are effective, efficient and transparent and
updated when necessary.
To achieve this, quarterly key control meetings were held with the
Auditor-General, programme managers of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport and the MEC.
It should
Assess and make appropriate recommendations for improving the governance processes in
achieving the Entitys objectives;
The Audit Committee is established as oversight bodies, providing independent oversight over
governance, risk management and control processes in the Entity, which include oversight and
responsibilities relating to:
Internal audit function;
External audit function as carried out by the Auditor-General of South Africa; Entity accounting and reporting;

FRAUD AND CORRUPTION
The Western Cape Government adopted an Anti-Corruption Strategy which confirms the
Provinces zero tolerance stance towards fraud and corruption.
The Entity has an approved Fraud
Prevention Plan and a Fraud Prevention Implementation plan which gives effect to the Fraud Prevention Plan.
Various channels for reporting allegations of fraud and corruption exist and these are described in
detail in the Provincial Anti-Corruption Strategy and the Entities Fraud Prevention Plan.
Each
allegation received by the Forensic Investigation Unit is recorded in a Case Management System
which is used as a management tool to report on progress made with cases relating to the Entity
We protect employees who blow the
whistle on suspicions of fraud, corruption and theft if the disclosure is a protected disclosure (i.e. not malicious).
Once fraud or corruption is confirmed after completion of an investigation, the relevant employee
who participated in these acts is subjected to a disciplinary hearing.
In all such instances, the
WCG representative initiating the disciplinary proceedings is required to recommend dismissal of
the employee concerned.
Where prima facie evidence of criminal conduct is detected, a
criminal matter is reported at the South African Police Services.
During this financial year, 1 investigation was completed by the Forensic Investigation Unit
confirming Fraud or Corruption.
At the end of the financial year, 2 matters remained on the case list of the Entity.
10 MINIMISING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The WCCC ensures that there are no conflicts of interest by insisting that a Declaration of Interest
(WCBD4 form) is obtained from every supplier not registered on the Western Cape Supplier
Database.
Before doing business with suppliers who are registered on the database, checks are
done to verify that their WCBD4 declarations are not more than 12 months old.
Provincial Treasury is assisting entities to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest where owners or
directors of companies are also public servants in the Western Cape.
This is done by providing
information from PERSAL (the Personnel Salary System) about public servants who are registered as
owners or directors of companies.
The entity ensures that such persons possess a Remunerative
Work Outside the Public Service (RWOPS) approval letter before doing business with them.
The entity has not found any conflict of interest with any business concluded with suppliers.
If such
Management activity and, after a due diligence investigation, the supplier will be identified as a
non-preferred service provider.
11 CODE OF CONDUCT
The policy implemented by DCAS incorporates the WCCC.
The purpose of the Code of Conduct is
to promote a high standard of professional ethics in the workplace.
The WCCC strives to adhere
and comply with the content of the Code.
Employees are made aware of the content of the
Code of Conduct through, among other things, the compulsory induction of all newly appointed
employees.
The Code was distributed to all employees as a reminder to continue promoting high
standards of professional ethics in the workplace.
If and when the content of the code is
WESTERN CAPE CULTURAL COMMISSION  ANNUAL REPORT 2013/14 24
breached, managers make use of progressive discipline as necessary.
More serious offences are
referred to the Corporate Services Centre (Directorate Employee Relations) for formal disciplinary
procedures.
12 HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
The policy as implemented by DCAS incorporates the WCCC.
Health and safety issues are
addressed by conducting monthly inspections at DCAS Head Office and annual audit inspections
at all other offices of the Department.
Contingency plans and business continuity plans have been
compiled for all the offices.
The managers at all offices have been appointed as health and safety
risk coordinators, safety marshals, first aiders and fire-fighters and trained.
Annual fire drills are conducted at offices in the Cape Town city centre in collaboration with the
Department of Community Safety and the Disaster Risk Management Department of the City of
Cape Town which monitor and provide comment in respect of all processes.
Occupational health and safety meetings are held quarterly at top management level to discuss
health, safety and environmental issues.
The holding of annual health and safety awareness programmes has considerably raised the level
of awareness in the entity.
The entity has implemented a waste management programme.

PART E: FINANCIAL INFORMATION
1 REPORT OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL TO THE WESTERN CAPE PROVINCIAL PARLIAMENT ON THE
WESTERN CAPE CULTURAL COMMISSION
REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Introduction
1.
I have audited the financial statements of the Western Cape Cultural Commission set
out on pages 32 to 49, which comprise the statement of financial position as at
31 March 2014, the statement of financial performance, statement of changes in net
assets, the cash flow statement and the statement of comparison of budget and
actual amounts for the year then ended, as well as the notes, comprising a summary
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Accounting authoritys responsibility for the financial statements
2.
The accounting authority is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of
these financial statements in accordance with the South African Standards of
Generally Recognised Accounting Practice (SA Standards of GRAP), the
requirements of the Public Finance Management Act of South Africa, 1999 (Act No. 1
(PFMA) and section 15(6) of the Western Cape Cultural Commission and
Cultural Councils Act, 1998 (Act No. 14 of 1998) (WCCCA), and for such internal
control as the accounting authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
Auditor-generals responsibility
3.
My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my
audit.
I conducted my audit in accordance with the Public Audit Act of South Africa,
2004 (Act No. 25 of 2004) (PAA), the general notice issued in terms thereof and
International Standards on Auditing.
Those standards require that I comply with
ethical requirements, and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
4.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the
auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entitys
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entitys internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
5.
I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for my audit opinion.
Opinion
6.
In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Western Cape Cultural Commission as at 31 March 2014,
29
and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance
with SA Standards of GRAP and the requirements of the PFMA and the WCCCA.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
7.
In accordance with the PAA and the general notice issued in terms thereof, I report
the following findings on the reported performance information against predetermined
objectives for selected objectives presented in the annual performance report, non-
compliance with legislation as well as internal control.
The objective of my tests was
to identify reportable findings as described under each subheading but not to gather
evidence to express assurance on these matters. Accordingly, I do not express an
opinion or conclusion on these matters.
Predetermined objectives
8.
I performed procedures to obtain evidence about the usefulness and reliability of the
reported performance information for the following selected objective presented in
the annual performance report of the public entity for the year ended 31 March 2014:
To preserve, promote and develop arts and culture through the registration and
deregistration of cultural councils, the management of cultural facilities, research
and analysis (on pages 12 to 13).
9. I evaluated the reported performance information against the overall criteria of
usefulness and reliability. 10.
I evaluated the usefulness of the reported performance information to determine
whether it was presented in accordance with the National Treasurys annual
reporting principles and whether the reported performance was consistent with the
planned objectives.
I further performed tests to determine whether indicators and
targets were well defined, verifiable, specific, measurable, time bound and relevant,
as required by the National Treasurys Framework for managing programme
performance information. 11.
I assessed the reliability of the reported performance information to determine
whether it was valid, accurate and complete. 12.
I did not raise any material findings on the usefulness and reliability of the reported
performance information for the selected objective.
Additional matter
13.
Although I raised no material findings on the usefulness and reliability of the reported
performance information for the selected objective, I draw attention to the following
matter: Achievement of planned targets
14.
Refer to the annual performance report on pages 12 to 13 for information on the
achievement of the planned targets for the year.
Compliance with legislation
15.
I performed procedures to obtain evidence that the entity had complied with
applicable legislation regarding financial matters, financial management and other
related matters.
I did not identify any instances of material non-compliance with
specific matters in key legislation, as set out in the general notice issued in terms of
the PAA.

The financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis using a classification on the nature of
expenses in the statement of financial performance.
The financial statements differ from the budget, which is approved on the cash basis using the same classification.
A reconciliation between the actual amounts on a comparable basis as presented in the statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts and the actual amounts in
the cash flow statement for the period ended 31 March 2014 is presented below.
The financial statements and budget documents are prepared for the same period.
There is a
basis difference: the budget is prepared on a cash basis and the financial statements on the accrual basis.

* For the current financial year and consistent with previous years IPSAS 20 was used for related party disclosures.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GRAP requires management to make judgements, estimates,
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and
expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year or in the year of the revision
and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.

REVENUE
1.5.
Revenue is
recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits or service potential will flow to the entity
and when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, and specific criteria have been met for
the Entitys activities. Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised in surplus or deficit in
proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date.
The amount is not
considered to be reliably measurable until all contingencies relating to the transaction have been
resolved. Revenue from non-exchange transactions
1.5.1
1.5.1.1
An unconditional grant is recognised in revenue when the grant becomes receivable.
1.5.1.2
Conditional grants and receipts Unconditional grants
Services in-kind Revenue received from conditional grants, donations and funding are recognised as revenue to the extent that the
Entity has complied with any of the criteria, conditions or obligations embodied in the agreement.
To the extent that
the criteria, conditions or obligations have not been met, a liability is recognised.
Interest earned on investments is treated in accordance with grant conditions.
If it is payable to the grantor it is
recorded as part of the liability and if not, it is recognised as interest earned in the statement of financial performance.
Grants that compensate the Entity for expenses incurred are recognised in surplus or deficit on a systematic basis in the
same years in which the expenses are recognised.
1.5.1.3
Services in-kind are services provided by individuals to entities, without charge, but may be subject to stipulations.
Public Entity staff provide valuable support to the Entity in achieving its objectives; however, the service provided
cannot be measured reliably and therefore it is not recognised in the statement of financial performance or statement
of financial position.
The nature of the service is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, related parties.
1.5.2
Revenue received from interest on investments and current bank account.

1.7.1
Debts are written off when identified as irrecoverable.
Debts written off are limited to the amount of savings and /or
under spending of appropriated funds.
The write off occurs at year end or when funds are available.
No provision is made for irrecoverable amounts but amounts are disclosed as a disclosure note.
All other losses are recognised when authorisation has been granted for the recognition thereof.
1.7.2
Fruitless and wasteful expenditure is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position until such time as the
expenditure is recovered from the responsible person or written off as irrecoverable in the statement of financial performance.
1.7.3
Irregular expenditure is recognised as expenditure in the statement of financial performance.
If the expenditure is not condoned by the relevant authority it is treated as an asset until it is recovered or written off as
irrecoverable.
1.7.4
Transfers and subsidies are recognised as an expense when the final authorisation for payment is effected on the
system (by no later than 31 March of each year).

1.8.1.1 Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at cost which represents fair value.
After initial recognition, financial
assets are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method less an allowance for impairment.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months, which are classified as non-current assets.
1.8.2
A financial liability is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity. The financial
liabilities of the Entity are trade and other payables as reflected on the face of the statement of financial position and
the notes thereto.
There are two main categories of financial liabilities, the classification based on how they are measured. Financial
liabilities may be measured at:
Financial liabilities
Recognition and measurement
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Financial liabilities that are measured at fair value through surplus or deficit are stated at fair value, with any resulted
gain or loss recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Any other financial liability should be classified as
financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through surplus or deficit and are initially measured at fair value ,
net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest
expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
1.9
1.9.1
All items of plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.
Items of plant and equipment acquired at no or a nominal cost are initially recognised at fair value
at the date of acquisition and are subsequently carried at the initial determined fair value less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.
When parts of an item of plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items (major components) of plant and equipment.
The cost of an item of plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable
assets so as to bring them to a working condition for their intended use.
This excludes assets funded from government grants.
The cost price of assets funded from government grants are
reduced by the government grant relating to that asset.

Subsequent costs WESTERN CAPE CULTURAL COMMISSION
NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 March 2014
1.9.2
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the
item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and
maintenance costs are charged to the statement of financial performance during the financial year in which they are
incurred. Each part of an item of plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item shall
be depreciated separately.
1.9.3
Depreciation is recognised in surplus or deficit on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an
item of plant and equipment at the following rates:
Depreciation rates used are: Per annum
Computers and computer software 33.3%
Vehicles 20%
25%
Asset useful lives and residual values Depreciation begins when an asset is available for use and ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is
derecognised or classified as held for sale in accordance with GRAP 100.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately
to its recoverable amount.
1.9.4
Plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life taking into account residual values where appropriate.
The
actual useful lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on a number of
factors.
In re-assessing asset useful lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance
programmes are taken into account.
Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the
remaining life of the asset and projected disposal values.
1.9.5
An item of plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits or service potential
are expected from its continued use or disposal.
The carrying amounts of assets are written off on disposal (calculated

1.10
The assets are considered for impairment if there is a reason to believe that impairment may be necessary. An
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purpose of
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows
(cash-generating units).
Assets that have been identified as being impaired are reviewed at each reporting date.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS

Figures in Rand

The Entity makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition,
seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
1.11.1 Provision for impairment of receivables
An estimate for the impairment of receivables is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
The
provision for impairment debt shall be calculated on trade receivables only. The total impairment provision shall be
calculated either by individual debtor or at least per risk category.
1.12
The entity is exempt from VAT registration.
However, if any funding is received that requires the entity to register as a VAT
Vendor, such application will be lodged.

The Entity occupies the accommodation of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport and has access to the use of
their assets including the security services provided by the Department of Community Safety.
Risk Management
Market risk
The entitys activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate
, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The entity is not exposed to market risk, due to it being required to settle creditors within 30 days of receiving an invoice
as required by the treasury regulations and the PFMA.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
In terms of its
borrowing requirements, the entity ensures that adequate funds are available to meet its expected and unexpected financial commitments.
All outstanding accounts payable balances are due within 30 days of the reporting date.
Sensitivity analysis
At 31 March 2014, if the interest rates on variable rate financial instruments had been 1% higher/lower with all other
variables held constant, post-tax surplus for the year would have been R49,584 higher/lower.
Interest rate risk
The entitys risk profile consists of fixed and floating rate loans and bank balances which exposes the entity to fair value
interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk and can be summarised as follows:

entity.
The entity has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy parties.
Credit risk consists mainly of cash deposits, cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and trade debtors. The
entity only deposits cash with major banks with high quality credit standing and limits exposure to any one counter-
party.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting year, and management does not expect any losses from
non-performance by these counterparties.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (the Constitution) makes
provision for the right of access to any information held by the State, subject to
justifiable limitations, which includes the limitation to protect privacy.
1.2
The Constitutional Court interpreted the right of access to information as not merely
a right to obtain access to information for the exercise or protection of a right, but
also to ensure that there is an open and accountable administration at all levels of
government. 1.3
Section 32(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution reads as follows:
(1) Everyone has the right of access to
any information held by the State; and
any information that is held by another person and that is required
for the exercise or protection of any rights.
National legislation must be enacted to give effect to this right, and may
provide for reasonable measures to alleviate the administrative and financial
burden on the state.
1.4 The aforesaid resulted in the enactment of the Promotion of Access to Information
Act, 2000 (PAIA).
The purpose of PAIA is to foster a culture of transparency and
accountability in public and private bodies and to empower and educate the
people of South Africa to understand their rights. 1.5
This manual is compiled in terms of section 14 of PAIA which requires that the
Provincial Treasury must have a manual which sets out, amongst others, its structure
and functions, include an index of its records and services, provide assistance on
the procedure to access its records and services.

Cape Winelands drama Festival Finale
Robertson Town Hall
22 November 2014
ForeWord
The arts have the potential to enable people to creatively express what they feel, think
and aspire to.
As human beings, we all have potential and talent, but often our latent
talents need a catalyst before they can be expressed.
The Department of Cultural
Affairs and Sport (DCAS) has established such a catalyst for youth in the form of
the Cape Winelands and Eden Drama Development Programme.
This programme
has established an enabling environment and creative pathways for youth to give
The Drama Development Programme bears testimony to DCASs commitment to
providing opportunities for young people to learn, experience and be guided through
drama.
By engaging in this way, they get to experience the world in a positive and
inspirational way.
This initiative has provided youth with opportunities to learn from
specialists in the field, to be exposed to various facets of drama, and to explore the
many possibilities it may offer.
Through initiatives of this kind, DCAS brings together a variety of role players,
stakeholders, partners and communities to facilitate the sharing of resources,
information and knowledge.
The ultimate aim is to establish pathways for creativity
which could support the emergence of communities which are less prone to social ills.
I commend the youth who have participated in the programme so far.
May you go from
strength to strength in your attempts to make a difference.
I hope that you continue to
grow and follow the path of success.
May you go on to contribute to building inspired
and innovative communities, Better Together.

We are very proud of the fact that the Langeberg Arts and Culture Development
Programme is now in its 5th year of existence and that it is growing every year.
The
programme was started to develop the creative industries into a productive sector
of our local economy.
It mainstreams the arts in social and economic development to
address social ills and unemployment, especially among our youth.
The Cape Winelands Drama Festival is now in its second year and the number of
participating local youth drama groups is also growing.
Its through the Cape Winelands Drama Festival that some of our youth have been
given the opportunity to perform in a professional theatre for the first time.
Performing
in well-known theatres, such as the Baxter Theatre and Artscape alongside established
artists creates a wonderful platform and can open many doors for successful careers
in the arts. The partnership with the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport (DCAS), the
Baxter Theatre and Artscape has put the Langeberg Arts and Culture Development
programme on a growth trajectory.
We wish to see many of our youth benefit and
develop into artists who are held in high esteem.
As we augment our current tourism
portfolio to include cultural offerings, artistic activities such as local drama help us to
market the Langeberg as a preferred destination.
We are grateful for the opportunity to host the Cape Winelands Drama Festival finale
in the Langeberg once again!
On behalf of the people of the Langeberg Municipality, I welcome every one of you,
especially the artists who have put a lot of time and effort into their performances.
Good luck to all our participants.

BaCkground
The Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport is committed to improving the lives
of people through the arts.
Our vision is built on creating opportunities through
facilitating skills development, talent identification, forging meaningful partnerships,
and providing opportunities for individuals to excel.
DCAS believes that the development of the arts and culture community must be
supported to create visibility, infrastructure and permanence.
It does this through
building partnerships and human capital, and through facilitating opportunities beyond
the realm of the arts.
The productions featured here today are testimony to the success of the DCAS arts
and culture programme.
Here we see the fruits of the effective coordination of the
efforts of specialists in the field, communities, the municipality as well as professional
theatres.
DCAS ensures that the development of drama in the Cape Winelands goes further.
It does this by enabling the best to perform on the professional stages of Artscape, the
Baxter Theatre and the Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees (KKNK).
Enjoy the creative talent of the Cape Winelands and Eden districts!

note From the artistiC direCtor
The Winelands and Eden drama festivals have grown a lot at every level. We have
seen great talent emerging over the years.
All the previous winners of these festivals
have presented exciting home-grown drama emerging from these districts at the
Suidoosterfees, Zabalaza Theatre Festival and Absa Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees.
Even professional actors who have been in the industry for some time are dreaming
about having this kind of opportunity.
The commitment shown by the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport to this
programme is really amazing.
The Department is funding the programme and is also
actively involved in running it.
I feel sure that if more funders were to show this kind of
commitment, we could take arts to another level in this country.
No words can express how I am grateful to the Baxter Theatre Centre and Zabalaza
for believing in this programme and allowing me the space to make sure that we grow
this programme every year.
This years festival has taken things to new heights.
The participants benefited from
exposure to many gifted facilitators  Abdu Adams, Stuart Palmer, Ntombi Makhutshi
and many more.
Participants have worked together so well since the first workshop
where they presented their productions for feedback and development.
The groups
that perform at this finale were selected from showcases in various places.
Once we
identified the best productions, we continued to help the groups develop their works
at weekend workshops in Oudtshoorn and Groot Drakenstein.
We visited all the groups
again in October in their communities to further develop their works.
To all the municipalities I say, we cannot fail these artists.
Lets keep asking ourselves,
are we doing enough?
God bless you all

Summary of statistics
The Western Cape Library Service (WCLS) strives to bring library and information
services to the provinces approximately 5,882,734 million inhabitants through a
network of 343 libraries and library service points that are administered by local
authorities and institutions.
During the year 2011/12 the Service provided library
material for all these library centres, promoted the use of these resources, provided
training for staff and assisted local municipalities with the building of new or
upgraded public libraries.
Twenty two percent (22%) of the inhabitants of the Western Cape Province
(5,882,734 million people according to the last census, Stats SA, 2011) are currently
registered members.
Our partnership with municipalities enabled the Library Service
to provide library and information services to 1,262,201 registered library patrons.
Library members borrowed 20,241,894 million items from 343 public libraries during
million items.
Service delivery to public libraries is thus being expanded on an
3
ongoing basis and currently reaches the whole geographical area of the Western
Cape.
The year under review was characterised by the enormous task of completing 354
stocktakes in 506 working days to achieve a 100% stocktake of all public libraries,
service points and the book stacks housed at the Western Cape Library Service.
This was necessitated by the new classification of books and audiovisual resources
from inventory items to assets by National Treasury.
This process started in August
2011 and the huge task of scanning approximately 6.3 million items located at 358
locations  including the collections in the stacks as well as the music and
audiovisual collections held at the Central Organisation  was completed in record
time by the end of February 2012.
Two new public libraries were opened: one in Klapmuts and one in Khayelitsha.
The Paarl Library was moved to new premises.
Six new Wheelie Wagons (WW) (a
were added during 2011/12: Fairview near Knysna (Knysna Municipality),
Waboomskraal near George (George Municipality), Toekoms near Mosselbay
(Mosselbay Municipality), Brakfontein near Riversdal (Hessequa Municipality),
Versfeld near Piketberg (Bergriver Municipality) and Laaste Drift near Witzenberg
(Witzenberg Municipality).
The Klapmuts Primary School Public Library, one of the first fully fledged dual
purpose libraries in South Africa, was opened on 18 August 2011.
This exciting
venture, which serves both as a school library for the 1,326 learners of Klapmuts
Primary School as well as a public library for the 9,000 inhabitants of the Klapmuts
community, could become a role model for the future.
Both learners and the wider
and recreational facilities, catering specifically for teenagers and young adolescents.
The development of this library was made possible by a grant from the Carnegie
4
Corporation of New York as well as funding from the German Development Bank
through their Violence Prevention through Urban Upgrading Project (VPUUP).
The Paarl Library was moved to its new, bigger and upgraded premises in Main
Street, Paarl.
The new facility was opened on 9 March 2012, exactly 45 years after
affiliation of the Paarl Public Library in 1967 to the Library Service. The Paarl Library
now has an activity hall, a multimedia room, a much bigger reference and childrens
section and an attractive new venue where teenagers can gather.
A major breakthrough regarding the funding of public library services was made
during 2011 when the Department Of Cultural Affairs and Sport received
R31,770,000 for the newly established Municipal Replacement Fund (MRF).
The
bulk of this fund  R31,268,000 has already been transferred to fifteen vulnerable
(B3) municipalities in the Western Cape, covering the personnel costs of 201 library
staff members and thus enhancing the quality of public library services in the
Province. The balance of R502,000 was earmarked for establishing and running the
new Municipal Replacement Funding Unit at the Western Cape Library Service,
whose mandate will be to manage the fund.
To contribute to a responsive economic infrastructure network and to be responsive
to an effective and accountable government system, the directorate funded the
migration of 72 library centres in 13 municipalities from PALS to SLIMS (SITA Library
Information Management System powered by Brocade).
Approximately two million Rand was spent on this project.
A total of 373 library workers were trained.
5
survey for all library centres as well as conducting a situational analysis of school
libraries in the Western Cape and making recommendations for areas of possible
support and cooperation between school and public libraries.
Acts, rules, regulations and provincial strategies
Legislation that impact on the Western Cape Library Service includes the following:
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act 108 of 1996)
In accordance with Annexure 5, libraries (excluding national libraries) are an
exclusive provincial legislative competency. The local management and
administration of public libraries is an unfunded mandate and the WCLS
needs to accept this responsibility.
The Constitution of the Western Cape, 1997 (Act 1 of 1998), Section 5
The official languages Afrikaans, English and isiXhosa are to be used and

Provincial Library Service Ordinance, 1981, Ordinance 16 of 1981
The Western Cape Library Service still functions in accordance with
Ordinance 16 of 1981, which indicates that a free public library service is the
joint responsibility of the provincial library service and local authorities.
to the Library Service, provided that the authority concerned undertakes to
comply with the provisions of the regulations of 1981 with regard to a free
provincial library service.
In accordance with these regulations it is the
responsibility of municipalities to erect a facility adhering to the minimum
standards of the Library Service, to appoint staff and to manage the library in
accordance with provincial library service standards.
The library, however,
remains under the control of the local authority.
The South African Public Library and Information Services Bill remained under
discussion during the year under review.

Regional Organisation
The Regional Organisation, which consists of three control areas, namely Outeniqua,
Boland and Metropole, is divided into 15 regions that serve 343 public libraries in the
Western Cape.
The Metropole Control Area provides library material and professional guidance to
109 public libraries in the City of Cape Town.
This area is divided into five regions
namely Blaauwberg, Cape Town, False Bay, Southern and Tygerberg Region.
The Boland Control Area provides library material and professional guidance to133
public libraries or library service points: Overstrand and Theewaterskloof (Hermanus
Region), Berg River, Saldanha Bay and Swartland (Saldanha Region), Drakenstein
and Stellenbosch (Stellenbosch Region), Cederberg and Matzikama (Vanrhynsdorp
Region) and Breede Valley and Witzenberg (Worcester Region).
The Outeniqua Control Area provides library material and professional guidance to
101 public libraries and library service points in the following municipalities: Beaufort
West, Laingsburg and Prince Albert (Beaufort West Region), George, Knysna and
Bitou (George Region), Hessequa and Mossel Bay (Mossel Bay Region),
Oudtshoorn, Kannaland and two libraries from the George District (Oudtshoorn

The main functions of the regions are the provision of library material and equipment
to public libraries, professional guidance and training of public librarians and
assistance with the building of library facilities.
Once new material has been through
the preparation processes, they are allocated to the regions, who in return allocate
them to the public libraries under their jurisdiction.
Public librarians have the
opportunity to select new books from their regional libraries.
Regional librarians also
visit public libraries in their region to provide new library material and to do collection building.
During the calendar year January to December 2012, the Library Services processed
222,461 new items of library material and to 343 library centres in the Western Cape.
In addition, the Service procured 206,574 items and subscribed to 6,931 periodicals
and newspapers on behalf of public libraries.
The Regional Organisation was presented with a huge task in July 2011, when
Provincial Treasury instructed the organisation to undertake a 100% stocktake of all
library material held in the 354 library service points throughout the Western Cape.
This had become necessary as National Treasury had made changes to the
accounting framework and books are now regarded as assets.
The huge task of
doing this comprehensive stocktake meant having to do intensive planning, taking
into account factors such as annual plans, tours, leave of staff, available PDTs,
vehicles, manpower, distances to be travelled between libraries, the SLIMS rollout as
well as the holiday season and public library staff availability as well as doing bid
processing in record time to achieve this in a time frame of seven months.
This 100 % stocktake was completed on 29 February 2012 in time for the financial
year end.
A total of 354 stocktakes were done in 506 working days with only three

Public libraries, depots and Wheelie Wagons
Two new libraries were opened during 2011/12: Klapmuts Library (Stellenbosch
Municipality) and Harare Square Library in Khayelitsha (City of Cape Town).
The
Paarl Library was moved to new, upgraded premises.
A fully fledged dual purpose library in South Africa, the Klapmuts Primary School
Public Library, was opened on 18 August 2011.
The thought of combining a school
library with a public library was first mooted by the principal of Klapmuts Primary
School and his dream became reality for this community which is characterised by
challenging socio-economic conditions.
The school library serves 1,326 learners of
Klapmuts Primary School, but also serves as a resource centre with free Internet
access for the 9,000 inhabitants of the Klapmuts community.
The model of a dual purpose library is receiving more and more attention nationally
and internationally and this very successful example of a dual purpose library could
be emulated elsewhere. 13
Harare Square Library, situated in Khayelitsha, opened its doors to the public on 3rd
June 2011. This library is unique in that it contains 20 computer work stations which
provide free Internet access through the Smartcape network, the largest number of
these workstations available in a community library in the Western Cape. It also
contains a study hall, an area for teenagers to hang out, meeting rooms and a
gaming room with a Wii gaming console.
The development of this library was made
possible by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York as well as funding
from the German Development Bank through their Violence Prevention through
Urban Upgrading Project (VPUUP).
The Paarl Library under the jurisdiction of the Drakenstein Municipality, was moved
to new premises and the new facility was opened on 9 March 2012, exactly 45 years
after affiliation of the Paarl Public Library in 1967 to the then Provincial Library
Service.
A highlight of the opening was the inauguration of the multimedia-room with
12 workstations providing free Internet access to this library community through
donations from the ITC Rural Connectivity.
As part of the extended rural service commonly known as Wheelie Wagons which
aims at taking library services to remote rural areas without easy access to library
facilities, six sites started operating in the small rural communities of Fairview near
Knysna (Knysna Municipality), Waboomskraal near George (George Municipality),
Toekoms near Mosselbay (Mosselbay Municipality), Brakfontein near Riversdal
(Hessequa Municipality), Versfeld near Piketberg (Bergriver Municipality) and Laaste
Drift near Witzenberg (Witzenberg Municipality).

Wagons per region.

The three main groups of audiovisual materials being circulated in public libraries are
videos, CDs and DVDs.
There is a gradual rise in the use of DVDs in public
libraries, whereas the demand for videos is dwindling.
Only 2,210 cassettes were
circulated during the review period  these together with videos are gradually being
phased out from library stocks.
The demand for audio books is, however, steadily
increasing and 17,181 items in this category were circulated in libraries during
2011/12.

In this review period there were 37 Wheelie Wagons in the Library Service.
Some
smaller communities in rural areas with an underdeveloped infrastructure are
deprived of books, reading material and access to information as provided by the
existing public library network.
The Wheelie Wagon project was consequently
launched as a pilot project to reach potential readers in rural areas for whom a visit
to the nearest public library would entail travelling quite a distance.
New Wheelie
Wagons are constantly opened in regions.
However, due to certain circumstances a
number of Wheelie Wagons have also been withdrawn.
The following Wheelie Wagons were opened during 2011/12: Fairview near Knysna
(Knysna Municipality), Waboomskraal near George (George Municipality), Toekoms
near Mosselbay (Mosselbay Municipality), Brakfontein near Riversdal (Hessequa
Municipality), Versfeld near Piketberg (Bergriver Municipality) and Laaste Drift near
Witzenberg (Witzenberg Municipality).
Conditional Grant
The year 2011/12 marked the fifth year of the Conditional Grant funding.
The purpose of the grant is to transform urban and rural community library infrastructure,
facilities and services (primarily targeting previously disadvantaged communities)
through a recapitalised programme at national, provincial and local government
level.
The Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport received R48,694 million from the
National Department of Arts and Culture of which R41,198 million was transferred to
the 25 municipalities in the province for payment of additional public library staff,
purchasing of office and furniture equipment and upgrading and maintenance
projects.
By the end of the financial year 292 staff were employed in the 25
municipalities in question.
An amount of four million Rand (included in the R41 million transferred to
was transferred to Drakenstein Municipality for the upgrading of the
Paarl Library. 20
As part of the extended rural library service commonly known as Wheelie Wagons,
which aims at taking library services to remote rural areas without easy access to
library facilities, six sites started operating in the year under review.
A total of 31,878 items of library material were purchased for Wheelie Wagons in
order to inculcate a culture of reading in remote rural areas.
The Library Service in partnership with e-Innovation continued to roll-out and provide
information and communication technology (ICT) to rural public libraries with funding
from the Conditional Grant.
In the year under review 21 libraries benefitted.
Internet costs and services are paid for and maintained at 81 sites across the province.
Transfer payments were made in three tranches as scheduled into the
accredited accounts of the municipalities.
An amount of R7,496,000 was used for
personnel and operational costs of the unit managing the grant and centrally
managed projects such as ICT and procurement of library material. Monthly
expenditure reports were submitted on a standard template by all 25 municipalities.

Municipal Replacement Funding
Municipal Replacement Funding was received for the first time during the adjustment
budget of the 2011/12 financial year.
The aim of this fund is to supplement municipal
investment into library services and to sustain the future professional delivery and
development of such services in the 15 B3 municipalities of the Western Cape.
An
amount of R31,770,000 was received from Provincial Treasury of which R31,268 m
was transferred to the 15 municipalities as one tranche.
The expected outputs include the number of B3 municipalities (15) receiving
replacement funding transfer payments and the number of library staff (201) funded
through replacement funding.
Transfers were made as scheduled into the
accredited accounts of the municipalities.

A project underway for 2012/13 is the establishment of a Wheelie Wagon at
Volmoed Primary School in the Oudtshoorn Municipality.
Projects for 2013/14 will
include Tesselaarsdal Primary School in the Theewaterskloof municipal area and
Avian Park Primary in Breede Valley.
The primary function of the WCLS is the provision of library material to affiliated
public libraries.
This is done through a centralised system of selection, acquisition,
cataloguing and processing of materials that are distributed to public libraries via a
network of regional libraries.
The Central Organisation is responsible for the

24 material, the management of the computerised library system, financial
administration and support services as well as reference services, research,
publication and promotion.
The Central Organisation comprises three units, namely
Selection and Acquisitions, Technical Services and General Services.
Selection and Acquisitions
In the Selection Section the work is centralised around two main areas, namely
reviews and the selection and acquisition of library material.
Book reviews are written
by a team of professional librarians.
Although book selection is mainly covered here,
Selection is also responsible for audiovisual material, namely CDs, DVDs and other
formats. In the Acquisitions Section the focus is on the ordering, procurement and
payments of new library material.
Books reviewed (2007-2011)
As a result of various factors such as budget cuts and the phasing in of the new
SLIMS system, which has slowed work down, there was a slight drop in the number
of books reviewed.
There was, however, a considerable increase in the amount of
library material procured.

Book Selection
Book selection meetings, attended by book selectors, public and regional librarians,
are held twice a month.
Prior to this, titles received on approval from registered
vendors are professionally reviewed with reviews available on the SLIMS database.
Public librarians send in requests for titles after reading the reviews online or by
26 viewing the books before the selection meeting if they are not able to attend.
In the
current period under review 12 meetings were held to select adult material and 11 for
childrens books.
Ordering and Payments
After book selection meetings, quantities and bibliographic details are checked.
The signed requisitions are taken to the Orders Section where orders are placed with vendors.
Below is an indication of the library material procured as per financial year.

Technical Services Technical Services comprises the Computer, Cataloguing and the Preparations Sections. Computer Section
with library management software, i.e. SLIMS and also other ICT (Information and
as the State Information Technology Agency (SITA), and LIBTECH.
SLIMS (SITA Library Information Management System powered by
Brocade)
SLIMS was implemented at 72 library centres in 13 rural municipalities.
All PALS
libraries had to migrate to SLIMS due to the imminent switch-off at the end of
November 2011.
The priority was to migrate the PALS circulating libraries to SLIMS.
The Computer Section was able to migrate some manual libraries during this
process as well.
The process enabled libraries within a municipality to be on the
same library management system.
The implementation of SLIMS at rural public libraries will continue for the next
financial year.
Cataloguing Section 28
The main function of the Cataloguing Section is to make an online catalogue
available on SLIMS.
In this context it is referred to as the engine of the Library
Service.
It is essential for staff to load information as accurately as possible in order
to ensure the successful retrieval of information by library users. Original
cataloguing for fiction books is done as it is faster to enter fiction titles on SLIMS than
to download from WorldCat.
Copy cataloguing of non-fiction titles is done from
WorldCat.
The cataloguers also have to assist public libraries with cataloguing.
The output of the Cataloguing Section was negatively affected by the changeover
from PALS to SLIMS on 1 February 2011.
There are several reasons for this:
The structure of the catalogue changed, so that instead of each library having
their own separate catalogue as in PALS, there is now only one single
catalogue in SLIMS.
As some PALS catalogues contained a lot of badly-input and inconsistent
data, this has all been added to the single SLIMS catalogue now.
While some of the cataloguers continued with their core job of cataloguing,
other cataloguers had to be involved virtually full-time with sorting out the
many technical conversion problems such as hundreds of blank catalogue
records on the database.

The main purpose of the Preparations Section is the receipt, processing and
dispatching of new library material.
The activities range from the initial receipt of
new library material to the final dispatch of weekly consignments to fifteen regional
libraries and Central Reference (SN) within the Western Cape.
The receipt and
preparation of books include those that have been ordered by the Conditional Grant
Unit. Below is an indication of the number of library material processed as per financial year.

Library Week
The annual Library Week 2012 event was launched in the new hall of the Paarl
Public library and was attended by the Western Cape Minister of Cultural Affairs and
Sport, Dr Ivan Meyer.
The purpose of celebrating Library Week is the marketing and promotion of libraries
to existing and potential library users and to create awareness in communities of the
importance of the public library in their area.
Library Week strives to encourage
public libraries to highlight the cultural, educational and recreational role they play in
communities as well as promoting the vital role libraries play in the information and
technological age, as much of the work we do has become information based.
The theme for Library Week 2012 focused on the youth and teenagers, hence the
reason for the theme: Stay connected @ your library.
Promotional material was
provided to the public libraries during Library Week enabling librarians to organise
activities for the communities whom they serve.
Colourful promotional material was 33
produced such as recyclable plastic library bags, bookmarks in the shape of a cell
phone; balloons; attractive posters; practical activity books for children; multi-
functional library stickers and peak sun visors.
Limited additional promotional
material was produced for the launch of Library Week 2012, such as highlighters and
cell phone pouches. In addition 1,000 spun bound library bags were showcased at the launch of Library
Week to promote a potential alternative library bag that is environmentally friendly
and sustainable. Intense focus was placed on the information resources and the
information services in our public libraries during this promotional week.
Posters
Librarians regard posters as an essential tool for displays and library promotion.
Displays also constitute a crucial facet of library work and this section endeavours to
enable librarians to achieve this objective imaginatively.
Contributions regarding
themes for displays and posters are provided annually by librarians.
Number of posters produced: 4
Number of posters distributed to public libraries: 4,000

National Book Week 2011 was launched in both Gauteng and Cape Town. The
Western Cape Provincial Library Service showcased a demo library themed
Getting to Know your Library and hosted a satellite National Book Week 2011 from
5 to 10 September 2011 at the Liberty Promenade Shopping Mall in Mitchells Plain
in partnership with the City of Cape Town Libraries.
The event coincided with the
launching of a poster to celebrate International Literacy Day which took place on 8
September 2011.
To symbolize the kick-off of the Rugby World Cup, a colorful
poster was launched on Friday, 9 September 2011.
In order to familiarise people who have never been in a library before with the look
and feel of one, the demo library was built with three banner walls reflecting library
shelves with books, a Wheelie Wagon complete with books, computers, a loan and
issuing desk, chairs, promotional material, posters and library application forms.
Members of the public were advised on the requirements to become a member of
their local public library.
The minister of the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport, Dr Ivan Meyer, officially
opened the demo library on the first day of National Book Week.
Between 5,000 to10,000 people visited the demo library and completed application
forms to become members of their local public library and more than 5,000 children
were reached with activities such as story hours and face painting.
Promotional
material hand-outs also formed part of the programme.
Hundreds of application
forms were completed and were allocated to relevant public libraries in Mitchells
Plain. At the same time awareness was created with more than 1.2 million library
users and approximately three million people in Cape Town through the media,
which included high profile interviews on radio stations, the Cape Gateway web site
and articles covering the event in various local newspapers.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (the Constitution) makes
provision for the right of access to any information held by the State, subject to
justifiable limitations, which includes the limitation to protect privacy.
1.2
The Constitutional Court interpreted the right of access to information as not
merely a right to obtain access to information for the exercise or protection of a
right, but also to ensure that there is an open and accountable administration at
all levels of government.
1.3
Section 32(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution reads as flows:
(1)
Everyone has the right of access to
any information held by the State; and
any information that is held by another person and that is required for the
exercise or protection of any rights.
National legislation must be enacted to give effect to this right, and may
provide for reasonable measures to alleviate the administrative and
financial burden on the state.
1.4
The aforesaid resulted in the enactment of the Promotion of Access to Information
Act, 2000 (PAIA).
The purpose of PAIA is to foster a culture of transparency and
accountability in public and private bodies and to empower and educate the
people of South Africa to understand their rights.
1.5
This manual is compiled in terms of section 14 of PAIA which requires that the
Department of the Premier (DotP) must have a manual which sets out, amongst
others, its structure and functions, include an index of its records and services,
provide assistance on the procedure to access its records and services.

Introduction
The Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport regards as binding the legislative mandate
which is the protection, promotion and preservation of arts, culture and heritage in the
Western Cape.
It is against this background that research into the challenges faced by
communities with regard to initiation practices was commissioned in 2007, in line with the
Batho Pele Principles that require wider public participation.
The research also highlights
the unique challenges that the province faces with regards to identification and
management of sites, safe and hygienic practices, pre- and post-care, cultural value of
initiation, social and family roles and responsibilities of initiates.
The approach for the framework is informed by the following:
It is based on the premise that initiation is a cultural issue with health implications;
The initiative is led and driven by the Department, community structures, the
Task Team on Initiation;
The process is research-based and therefore has an informed point of departure;
It is a phased and targeted approach; and
It is consultative.
2 Background and approach
Initiation practices are universal and found in many cultures.
They come in many forms
and have many institutional expressions.
They are historical indicators used by human
communities to mark the transit from one stage of life to another.
They are rites of passage
acknowledging the inclusion of an individual or individuals into a group or society.
Universally known examples of initiation include the Christian baptism or the Jewish bar
mitzvah.
Initiation as a rite of passage is often viewed too simply and superficially.
Many
commentators and policy-makers equate initiation solely with circumcision (see the Report
on Public Hearings on Initiation Schools in South Africa by the Cultural, Religious and
Language Rights Commission p.
which address misfortune, and rites of passage.
Male initiation rites fall into the latter, and
illustrate the transition from boyhood (ubukhwenkwe) to manhood (ubudoda). The
initiation practices of amaXhosa, abeSotho and amaHlubi are most dominant in the
Western Cape.
No particular age is specified for these rites (boys between the ages of 15
Initiation is an important social device for dealing with
The training and preparation provided at the initiation schools enables the
shift from childhood behaviour to the more complex behaviour expected of adults
(Shlegel, A & Barry, H. 1991.
Adolescence: An anthropological inquiry).
The initiation schools are regarded as cultural educational institutions where initiates are
taught the values inherent in social responsibility, discipline and acceptable conduct, as
well as more about their culture.
The values filtered down to younger boys as they grow
into manhood are critical to their social and psychological development in the middle
stage between childhood and adulthood.
The adolescent stage, according to Mead (Mead, M. 1928.
Coming of age in Samoa: a
psychological study of primitive youth for Western civilization), if not monitored, could be
destructive for the individual adolescent, the family and the community.
Mead goes on to describe this stage as a delicate stage.
The boy is neither a child any longer, nor is he a
man, and so developmentally he is excluded from the community.
She argues that, This is
the time when teenagers begin to look beyond themselves and they are in this stage
faced with two choices: to join the ranks of responsible adults or follow the band with his
peers in an alternative society (Mead, 1973, p.
The role of initiation therefore becomes
critical in helping to steer a young man towards becoming a fully responsible and
dignified man in his community. Even though the practice has survived the passage of time, the need for some
modernisation is accompanied by some challenges.
Its resilience is being tested against its
capacity to adjust to and accommodate modern tendencies, while at the same time
right.
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa is very clear on the protection and
These rights are guaranteed by the various constitutional
2
3 The Western Cape context
Historically the Western Cape has the smallest number of people who adhere to and
practice the culture of initiation as practised amongst the amaHlubi, abeSotho and
amaXhosa communities.
This practice is one of the cornerstones of the culture of the
groups mentioned above. Studies have shown that male circumcision has been common
in some communities for almost 5 000 years and is today practiced by about one sixth of
the worlds population (Helman, C. 2000.
Culture, health and illness, p.
. Initiation
practice is deeply rooted in our communities, not only in the rural areas of the Province,
but also in the Metro.
4 The challenges
Increase in drug and alcohol abuse at initiation sites;
Some carers and surgeons have not been trained;
Poor and unhealthy living conditions in the initiation schools and sites;
Lack of observation and maintenance of proper health standards at circumcision
schools and sites;
New/emerging diseases, e.g. HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis;
Unhealthy environmental conditions, e.g. swamps or dumpsites nearby;
Lack of natural vegetation necessary for the practice;
Environmentally unsustainable utilisation of sites;
Most suitable land in private hands;
Increase in initiates from single-headed households;
Lack of civic guidance and leadership;
Migration to the city; and
Impact of modernisation.
5 Goals
The goal of this framework is to create a safe and an enabling environment that will make
possible effective rites of passage to responsible adulthood and citizenship.
6 Objectives
To develop and strengthen community and governmental initiatives that improve
cultural practice of initiation;
To provide guidelines for the practice of initiation;
To minimise misunderstandings between communities and government on initiation
practices; To enhance inter-provincial cooperation;
To institutionalise and mainstream this practice as part of the cultural landscape in
the Western Cape;
To improve the standards and current practices; and
To encourage community participation and involvement.
7 Key elements
Stakeholder consultation and management;
Training, monitoring and quality assurance measures;
Provincial coordination;
Minimum standards for the practitioners.
7.1 Stakeholder consultation and management
The Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport is the lead stakeholder in line with its
mandate of protecting and conserving the cultural heritage of the Province.
The
Department facilitates and coordinates the input of the diverse stakeholders involved in
the process.
This is in line with section 6.2 of the Batho Pele White Paper which states,
Batho Pele will therefore seek to establish partnerships with the wider community in which
business and industry, NGOs, CBOs, academic institutions and other bodies throughout the
7.1.1
Initiation forums
Initiation forums are the initial point of contact and a requirement for communities which
observe and practice initiation.
It is recommended that the forums are constituted of
individuals and institutions that have a direct stake or impact on the practice of initiation.
Civic leaders, practitioners, medical personnel and ward councilors are represented in
these structures.
The initiation forums should attend to matters related to the three phases,
that is pre-initiation, the initiation itself and the post-initiation phase.
Iingcibi (Traditional surgeons)
Iingcibi have a pivotal role in the leadership and realisation of this practice and are
valuable sources of an increasingly rare skill.
Iingcibi need extensive knowledge and skills
to be effective in their work.
They have a central stake in the training and without their
cooperation, consent and implementation, the practice might be negatively affected.
7.1.3 Amakhankatha (Carers)
The process of imparting the learning and lessons resides with them.
Amakhankatha are
responsible for caring for initiates and play an important role in the care of the initiate after
the circumcision phase. There is thus a need for capacity development among carers to
improve their ability to care and minimise injury and mortality.
7.1.4 Cape Nature
This organisations mandate
is to conservation and preservation of our natural
environment, an environment on which initiation practice has an impact.
Its contribution focuses on training and awareness-raising among communities to ensure that the practice
is environmentally sensitive and environmentally friendly.
In addition, the institution
and elsewhere, should the need arise.
It engages with communities to reduce land invasion in reserves.
7.1.5 The Department of Health
Initiation is a cultural practice with health implications. The Department of Health has the
appropriate infrastructure that can be utilised in the realisation of the programmes
objectives.
This department will also look at developing protocols and responses to the
Key disease outbreak
response and provincial
infection control,
for the
management of diseases and infections at initiation sites;
Admission to health care facilities in case of complications (including referral
The early detection of health complications in initiates;
Training of traditional surgeons, carers and monitors;
Controlled access to basic care material for trained practitioners at provincial
outlets and/ or clinics;
Outreach to traditional circumcision schools and support to the circumcision
programme; and  Maintaining a database and statistics through departmental infrastructure on
initiation sites.
7.1.6 Department of Public Works
The Department of Public Works has the expertise to assist in the development and
provision of appropriate infrastructure on initiation sites such as:
Identification of land ownership;
Negotiation for land to be used as initiation sites; and
The maintenance of such sites, utilising the Expanded Public Works Programme.
Agreements must be entered into for the utilisation of land belonging to national government.
7.1.7 Municipalities
Municipalities must ensure the provision of the necessary infrastructure, such as land, clean
water and sites for initiation.
Agreements must be entered into with communities and land
7.2 Training, monitoring and quality-assurance measures
on core areas of health and hygiene, fire management and control and
Training for the forum should be targeted at organisational development; and
Monitoring should focus on aspects pertaining to overall improvement of sites,
initiates, reduction in injuries and increased compliance.
7.3 Provincial coordination
The inter-
departmental forums will consist of and focus on the following:
Designated officials who can best align departmental programmes with the
requirements of the initiation programme;
Development of an annual integrated plan for initiation by the Stakeholder
Committee;
Ensuring and maintaining an accurate database of initiation in the Province; and
Identifying and responding to trends and patterns in initiation practices.
7.4 Provide guidelines and criteria on identification and development of
sites
Identification of potential initiation sites and the development thereof is according to the
criteria outlined below:

the location of facilities on the site, parking and access, long-term landscape
management and site security; and
8
and toilets should be considered; and
The removal of waste and fire safety should be addressed.
7.5 Minimum requirements for the phases of initiation
Pre-initiation
The preparatory phase enables families and communities to prepare advice and decide
on initiation.
This entails the following:
Signed proof of consent from the parents or legal guardian of any prospective
initiate under the age of 21 must be presented to the medical officer before the
medical check-up is undertaken;
Prospective initiates must undergo a medical check-up two months before the
initiation time to identify any potential health complications that may develop
during initiation.
This is done at local clinics and health institutions;
A certificate will be issued by the medical officer to the initiate and his family to
identify any special needs that the prospective initiate may have; and
The family and/ or a representative will register the prospective initiate with the
relevant forum and or ward councillor advising the site where initiation will take
place as well as the date.
During initiation
This phase ensures the health and well-being of the initiate and emphasises the following:
A traditional surgeon must use a sterilised instrument for circumcision;
A surgeon may not use the same instrument on more than one initiate;
The instrument to be used for circumcision must be approved by the initiates
guardian before it is used;
Trained monitors who are familiar with the practice will periodically visit the sites to
assess the health and welfare of the initiates, as well as hygiene and environmental
health at the site. Any issues of concern will be raised with the community structure
and the local health institution;
Such concerns will be addressed at local level where possible and will be recorded
by the local medical institution;
A medical officer who is familiar with the initiation practice will be called if any
complications arise and will make an appropriate decision, based on his
A report will be lodged with the relevant local health institution.
person other than a trained carer may treat an initiate;
A trained carer will be appointed for the initiate and no carer will take care of more
than five initiates at a time during an initation;
A carer must immediately report any sign of illness or injury to the monitors, a
medical officer or members of the local initiation structure; and
A carer must ensure that initiates in his care are not exposed to the elements and/
or extreme cold or dehydration, especially during the first eight days of the initiates
confinement.
Post initiation
Initiates, who, due to various circumstances, are released from the initiation school before
being completely healed will be treated at local medical institutions.
Medical personnel
must take care to ensure confidentiality during the treatment process.
8 Legislation and other mandates
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act 108 of 1996);
Application of Health Standards in Traditional Circumcision, (Eastern Cape),(Act no
; and
Traditional Practitioners Act (Act 22 of 2007).
9 Conclusion
Initiation is one of the few cultural practices that has endured and survived social,
economic and political changes over the centuries.
This is testimony to the value that is
attached to this aspect of culture by the communities who practice it.
It is also testimony
to the practices ability to adapt to changing situations and settings.
This therefore requires that the Department, in line with its mandate, develops approaches
and frameworks that will not only make the practice safer, but ensure that it is in line with
current developments and adds value to the cultural lives of the communities of the
Province. 10 10 References

TPW November Update The Western Cape department of transport and public Works delivers infrastructure
and services to the people of the province to promote positive socio-economic
outcomes and safe, empowered and connected communities.
The Department has a number of notable achievements to report in November 2015.
#BoozeFreeRoads
Safer vehicles, safer learners
Provincial Minister of Health Dr Nomafrench Mbombo joined Provincial
Traffic Law Enforcement and the South African Police Service (SAPS)
at a #PayDayBlues weekend alcohol blitz roadblock on the N1 highway
near Paarl.
Hundreds of motorists were stopped by traffic officers, who
performed various driver and vehicle checks as well as alcohol breath
tests on the night.
A bus and a minibus taxi were impounded during a joint learner
transport and roadblock blitz on the R43 between Rawsonville and
Worcester.
Provincial traffic officers stopped 45 vehicles, including
seven learner transport vehicles. This was one of the many such
operations conducted by the Department every day across the
Western Cape.
Proof of address now required for vehicle licence renewals
With effect from 1 November 2015, the National Road Traffic Regulations require that any person wishing to renew a motor vehicle licence or operator
card must submit proof of full name, date of birth, identity, residential and postal address.
Bodies of persons (such as companies) must submit full
details of the body.
Western Cape traffic officials have been implementing the new requirements since they came into effect.

INTRODUCTION
The current constitutional dispensation in South Africa makes provision for the
right of access to any information held by the State (subject to justifiable
and to information held by a private body that is required for the
exercise or protection of any right.
The Constitutional Court interpreted the right of access to information as not
merely a right to obtain access to information for the exercise or protection of a
right, but also to ensure that there is open and accountable administration at all
levels of government.
Section 32(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996
(the Constitution) reads as flows:
(1) Everyone has the right of access to
any information held by the State; and
any information that is held by another person and that is
required for the exercise or protection of any rights.
National legislation must be enacted to give effect to this right, and
may provide for reasonable measures to alleviate the administrative
and financial burden on the state..
The aforesaid resulted in the enactment of the Promotion of Access to
Information Act, 2000 (PAIA).
The purpose of PAIA is to foster a culture of
transparency and accountability in public and private bodies and to empower and

In terms of section 14 of PAIA a public body must have a manual which sets out

INTRODUCTION
1.1
1.2 The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (the
Constitution) makes provision for the
right of access to any
information held by the State, subject to justifiable limitations, which
includes the limitation to protect privacy.
The Constitutional Court interpreted the right of access to information
as not merely a right to obtain access to information for the exercise
or protection of a right, but also to ensure that there is an open and
accountable administration at all levels of government.
1.3 Section 32(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution reads as flows:
(1) Everyone has the right of access to
any information held by the State; and
any information that is held by another person and that is
required for the exercise or protection of any rights.
National legislation must be enacted to give effect to this right,
and may provide for reasonable measures to alleviate the
administrative and financial burden on the state.
1.4 1.5
The aforesaid resulted in the enactment of the Promotion of Access
to Information Act, 2000 (PAIA).
The purpose of PAIA is to foster a
culture of transparency and accountability in public and private
bodies and to empower and educate the people of South Africa to
understand their rights.
This manual is compiled in terms of section 14 of PAIA which requires
that the Department of Community Safety must have a manual
