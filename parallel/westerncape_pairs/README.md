Western Cape Government has a fairly liberal license: https://www.westerncape.gov.za/copyright

The South African Constitution places a positive obligation on organs of state to disseminate public interest information held by the state as widely and cost-effectively as possible:

    "Transparency must be fostered by providing the public with timely, accessible and accurate information." - Constitution of South Africa s195(g).
    "Efficient, economic and effective use of resources must be promoted." - Constitution of South Africa s195(b).

We believe that the most cost-effective way of disseminating public interest state information is by allowing others to reproduce such material freely - as long as it is reproduced accurately. We therefore believe that conditional free licensing of state copyright in material promoting transparency is required by the Constitution.
