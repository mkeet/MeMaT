& konqueror; Basics
Like all & kde; applications, & konqueror; is highly configurable. This document describes how & konqueror; behaves with the normal, default settings.
A three button mouse can be useful when you are running & konqueror; or any other & kde; application. If your mouse only has two buttons then you should be able to set your system up so that you can simulate a & MMB; by pressing both buttons at the same time.
If you are used to having to double-click to perform an action, then take care, because in common with the rest of & kde;, & konqueror; defaults to single-clicking.
Starting & konqueror;
Being a combined File Manager and Browser, & konqueror; will automatically switch between the two modes as needed when it is running, but it is convenient to be able to choose which mode is to be used when you start it up.
If you have a house shaped icon on the panel or desktop, then left click on it to open & konqueror; as a file manager.
Or left click on world shaped icon on the panel or desktop to open & konqueror; in browser mode.
From the K menu, select Internet Konqueror Web Browser to start it as a browser, or Home to launch & konqueror; in file manager mode.
Alt; F2 will open a Run Command dialog box, type konqueror (lower case) and press Enter or the Run button to start in file manager mode, or just enter a & URL; such as http: / /www. konqueror. org to start & konqueror; as a browser.
& konqueror; is also started automatically when you left click on a desktop icon that represents a folder, such as a hard disk drive or the Trash icon.
The Parts of & konqueror;
A brief look at the main parts of & konqueror; 's window:
Here's a screenshot of & konqueror;
The Titlebar is the strip across the top of & konqueror; 's window, and operates in the same way as for other & kde; applications. Right click on the central portion to bring up the neat Titlebar menu.
The Menubar is the strip containing the names of the drop-down menus. Left click on a name to alternately show and hide that menu, or use Alt; the underlined letter in the name as a hot key, for example Alt; E to show the Edit menu. The various menus are described in the Menubar section of this document.
The Location Toolbar shows the path to the directory, & URL; or file being viewed. You can type a path or & URL; here and press & Enter; or left click on the Go icon at the right hand end of the Location Toolbar to go to it. The black icon at the left hand end of the Location Toolbar clears the text entry box.
The Bookmark Toolbar is the area under the Location Toolbar in the previous screenshot. You can add frequently used bookmarks here; see the Organizing Your Bookmarks section of this document.
The Window is the main area of & konqueror; and can show you the contents of a directory, web page, document or image. Using the Window menu you can split & konqueror; 's main window into one or more separate views, useful for drag and drop operations, or set it to contain two or more tabbed views.
The Status Bar runs across the bottom of the & konqueror; 's window and often shows general information about whatever the mouse pointer is hovering over. If you have split the main window into a number of views you will get an Status Bar for each view, and it will include a small green light at the left hand end to show which is the active view. Right clicking on the Status Bar brings up the Status Bar Right Mouse Button Menu.
Do n't worry if your & konqueror; does n't look exactly like this screenshot; it is highly configurable. In particular:
You can use the Settings menu to choose whether to show or hide the Menubar, Main Toolbar, Location Toolbar and Bookmark Toolbar, or even to add an Extra Toolbar.
You can also flatten the toolbars by left clicking on the vertical lines at the left hand end of the bars, or move them around by holding the & LMB; down while you drag these bars around.
For more details of how to change & konqueror; 's appearance, see the Configuring & konqueror; section
Tooltips and What's This?
You can find out a lot about how & konqueror; works without needing to read this entire document if you take advantage of Tooltips and the What's This? feature.
If Tooltips have been enabled in & kde; (K menu Control Center Appearance & Themes Style, Style dialog) then when you hover the mouse pointer over a Toolbar or Navigation Panel button it should bring up a terse description of what that button does.
What's This? is invoked by the Menubar Help What's This? item, by Shift; F1, or by just & LMB; clicking on the question mark near the top right hand corner of & konqueror; 's window. It changes the cursor to show a question mark alongside the arrow.
When this question mark is visible, a & LMB; click wo n't actually do anything until you have clicked on a control (or the text alongside it) that supports What's This?, in which case it will display a reasonably comprehensive description of what the control is supposed to do. Most of the dialog boxes that & konqueror; brings up support the What's This? feature.
Left and Middle Mouse Button Actions
If you click the & LMB; on an item in & konqueror; 's window, it will be activated. Thus
Left click on an icon in the Toolbar to do whatever that icon is supposed to do.
Left click on an item in the Menubar to make that menu drop down.
Left click on a menu item to do that thing.
Left click on an icon in the Bookmark Toolbar to open that & URL;.
Left click on a link in a web page to make & konqueror; follow that link.
Left click on a folder icon or name and & konqueror; will descend into (show the contents of) that folder.
Left click on a file name or icon and & konqueror; will do whatever it thinks appropriate, based on the file type. In general this means opening HTML pages, or previewing text, image or KOffice files, showing them within & konqueror; 's window (Preview means that you can see the file but not change it).
& konqueror; decides what the file type is by matching the filename extension against a list of known types. If that fails it tries to guess the type from the file contents. You can change the list of known file types and associated actions with the File Associations page of the Settings Configure Konqueror... dialog.
Right Mouse Button Menus
Clicking the & RMB; on almost any part of & konqueror; 's window will bring up an appropriate context menu.
If you have enabled the Right click goes back in history option in & konqueror; 's configuration settings a simple right click is equivalent to clicking on the Back button. In this case you can access the context menu by moving the mouse with the right button held down.
On the Titlebar
Right clicking on any free area of the Titlebar brings up the Titlebar Menu, allowing you to control the position of & konqueror; 's window as well as the decoration applied to all & kde; program windows.
On the Main Toolbar
Right click on any free area of the Toolbar to bring up the Toolbar Menu. You can use it to control whether the Toolbar is at the top, bottom, left or right of & konqueror; 's window. You can also use the Toolbar Menu to set the size of the buttons on the Toolbar, and whether they are shown as icons, text or both.
On the Location Toolbar
Right click in the & URL; entry box area to perform Cut, Copy, Paste or Clear operations in this area, or to change the automatic Text Completion features.
On the Bookmark Toolbar
If you have the Bookmark Toolbar showing, then right click on any free part of it to bring up the Bookmark Toolbar Menu which lets you change its position and whether items are shown as text, icons, or both.
Within a View
If you right click on any free area of a view then you will get a menu that contains, among other options, the Up, Back, Forward and Reload navigation commands.
On a File or Folder
This is a most useful feature. Right clicking on the name or icon of any file or folder not only selects that item but also brings up a menu allowing you to Cut, Move, Copy or Remove the item in various ways, add it to your Bookmarks, open it with the program of your choice or preview it, rename it, or edit the file type or properties.
On the Status Bar
Right click on the Status Bar at the bottom of a window or view to add or remove a view within & konqueror; 's window.
Viewing Help, Man and Info Pages
If you want to read & UNIX; Man pages & konqueror; makes it easy. For example type man: / touch or #touch into the Location Toolbar to see the page for the touch command.
To browse through & UNIX; Info pages, entering info: / dir takes you to Info's top level directory, then it's just a matter of clicking on the right links to find the page you want. Alternatively, use info: / command name to go straight to the Info page you want.
ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Using Bookmarks
Although you can use & konqueror; 's bookmarks to record the locations of your own files and folders, they are most useful when you are surfing the Web, letting you build up a list of useful sites.
To open the Bookmarks menu you may either left click on the Bookmarks menu or use the Alt; B shortcut. Once the list is visible, you can navigate through it with the arrow keys or with your mouse, then press & Enter; or left click to visit the selected location.
To add a new item to the list use Bookmarks Add Bookmark or Ctrl; B or right click on a clear space in the web page or folder view and select Bookmark this Location from the pop up menu.
The Bookmarks list can contain subfolders containing other bookmarks, you can create these with Bookmarks New Bookmark Folder.... To add a bookmark into a subfolder rather than into the main Bookmark list, select the folder from within the Bookmarks list and use the Add Bookmark item in that folder.
The Bookmark Editor
The Bookmarks Edit Bookmarks option opens the Bookmark Editor.
You can move an item to a different place in the list by using the normal Drag and Drop or Cut and Paste methods. The order in which the items appear in the Bookmark Editor is the order they will appear in the Bookmarks drop down list. The Insert Insert Separator option can be used to insert separating lines into the list wherever you wish.
A new subfolder can be created at the selected point in the list by using the Create New Folder... option in the Insert menu or from the drop down menu you get when you right click on an item in the main part of the window, or with Ctrl; N
To select which bookmark subfolder is used to hold the Bookmark Toolbar items select the subfolder then choose Set as Toolbar Folder from the Edit menu.
Do n't forget to save your changes with File Save or Ctrl; S before you leave the Bookmark Editor.

& konqueror; the Web Browser
Browsing www. konqueror. org
Connecting to the Internet
Once you are connected to the Internet you can use & konqueror; to browse the Web just as easily as you can use it to handle your local files. Just type a & URL; into the Location Toolbar window, press & Enter;, and you are away!
If you use a dial-up modem connection, then you will be using & kppp; or a similar dialer program to make the connection.
If your machine is connected to a local area network (LAN) that gives you a proxy connection to the Internet then you will have to set & konqueror; up for the proxy connection. This can be done with the Proxy page of the Settings Configure Konqueror... dialog.
If you are lucky enough to have a high speed cable connection, then the service provider will probably give you an external cable modem which needs an ethernet connection to your machine. Unfortunately the details of how to establish the connection depend on the service provider and to some extent on which Linux/ UNIX; distribution you are using. Some ISP s connect their customers to the Internet through a proxy server, in which case you will have to set up & konqueror; to use it. You may find it useful to search the archives of your distribution's user group mailing list for help.
An error message such as Unknown Host usually means that & konqueror; cannot find a connection to the Internet or that you have entered an incorrect & URL;.
Surfing and Searching
Once you have a connection to the Internet, you can surf with & konqueror; just as you can with any other browser.
Left click on a link in the page to go there.
To open a link in a new instance of & konqueror;, leaving the old page still visible, & MMB; click on the link or right click on it and select the Open in New Window option. Alternatively, you might want to Open in New Tab. Tabbed Browsing will let you hold a number of pages in one & konqueror; window and quickly switch between them with a single mouse click.
You could also select the multiple view mode with Ctrl; Shift; L or the Menubar Window Split View Left/ Right option which will let you see different pages at the same time. This can be useful if you are looking through a complicated set of HTML pages, but make sure the little link box at the bottom right hand corner is empty when you are doing this.
To go back to the previous page use the Alt; Left Arrow shortcut, the Back button on the Toolbar, or the Menubar Go Back option.
Similarly, once you have gone back you can go forward by using Alt; Right Arrow, the Forward button, or the Menubar Go Forward option.
If you want to stop the download for any reason then use the Esc key, the Toolbar Stop button or the Menubar View Stop item.
When you are viewing a web page you should see two new icons in the Toolbar, looking like magnifying glasses with small + and - symbols. Use these to adjust the size of the text in the page if you find it difficult to read. How well this works will depend on how the web page has been constructed.
Tabbed Browsing
Right clicking on a tab will bring up a menu with the following options:
To close the selected tab page.
To see what Web Shortcuts are available, and perhaps add your own, use Settings Configure Konqueror... to open the Settings dialog box and click on the Web Shortcuts icon.
To overcome this problem you can change the browser identification information that & konqueror; sends for specific sites or domains by selecting Settings Configure Konqueror... to bring up the Settings dialog box and clicking the Browser Identification icon.
Saving and Printing Web Items
When you are viewing a web page you can save it (or at least the basic & HTML; or similar source text) to your local disk with Location Save As.... If the page you are viewing uses frames, then you will also be given the Location Save Frame As... option. Left click in the frame you want to save first.
If the page uses a background image, you can get and save that with the Location Save Background Image As... option.
But if what you really want is that glorious picture of the latest Ferrari, then right clicking on the image will give you a drop-down menu with a Save Image As... option. Be sure to respect the owner's copyright, and ask for permission before using any pictures saved this way for anything other than your own viewing pleasure.
If you right click on a link (which may be a picture) and select Save Link As... from the pop up menu the basic & HTML; or similar source text will be downloaded and saved on your local disk.
Right clicking on a link (which may be a picture) and choosing Copy Link Location will copy the & URL; of the link to the clipboard so you can then paste it into, say, an e-mail to a friend telling her about this wonderful new site.
Right clicking on a picture and choosing Copy Image Location copies the & URL; of the picture to the clipboard.
Printing a copy of the page you are viewing is easily done with the Menubar Location Print... or Print Frame option or with the Toolbar Print button.
& FTP;
& FTP;, or File Transfer Protocol, is one of the earliest, and still perhaps the best, way of transferring files between computers over the Internet.
With & FTP; you can see files and folders on the distant computer just as if they were on your own system, download them onto your computer using & konqueror; 's normal Copy and Paste or Drag n 'Drop methods and, if allowed, upload files from your machine to the other computer's filesystem. To try it, type the & URL;
ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde
into the Location Toolbar and press & Enter;. As long as you are connected to the Internet, and as long as the & kde; 's & FTP; site is not too busy, you should end up seeing the / pub/ kde folder at & kde-ftp;
Although, strictly speaking, & FTP; & URL; s should be entered starting with ftp: / / and WWW & URL; s starting with http: / / & konqueror; is usually smart enough to figure out what is meant, and insert these characters for you if you leave them out.
When you access an & FTP; site it will usually need some form of username and password from you. To simplify things, most & FTP; sites that offer files for free downloading will accept the word anonymous as a username and your email address as a password, and to make your life even easier & konqueror; will automatically supply these without troubling you.
If you try to access an & FTP; site that does not need a proper username or password but which is too busy to accept any more connections, & konqueror; often interprets the busy message as a request for a name and password and will therefore pop up a dialog box asking you to supply them.
Sites that are more concerned with security will need a proper username and password, in which case & konqueror; will ask you for them or you can include the username in the & URL; you type into the Location Toolbar, as for example
ftp: / / username @ftp. cia. org
& konqueror; will then prompt you for the password.

ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Configuring & konqueror;
In common with the rest of & kde;, & konqueror; is highly configurable, so you can really get the look and feel that best fits your needs and wishes.
When & kde; is newly installed, & konqueror; 's window contains a Menubar, Main and Location Toolbars and possibly a Bookmark Toolbar.
Maybe you do n't need all these toolbars. To hide one of them, go into the Settings Toolbars menu and uncheck its box. To show a hidden toolbar, just check the box.
On the left hand end of each bar you can see some vertical lines. By & LMB; clicking on them, you flatten the bar, meaning that it is hidden but can be quickly restored by clicking on the now horizontal lines. You can also drag a bar into a new position with these lines.
If you right click on a Toolbar, you will get a menu to configure this bar. You can choose the orientation, text position and icon size
The icons shown in the various bars can be changed by using the Settings Configure Toolbars... option, which brings up the Configure Toolbars dialog box. The Main and Extra Toolbars are divided into sections, such as Main Toolbar & lt; konqueror; gt;, Main Toolbar & lt; khtmlpartgt; and Extra Toolbar & lt; khtmlsettingsplugingt;. The number and type of these sections will depend on whether & konqueror; is in Web Browser or File Manager mode and whether you have & konqueror; plugins installed.

Questions and Answers
Can I run & konqueror; from another window manager?
Just install & Qt;, kdelibs and kdebase, and from your favorite window manager, launch & konqueror;. It should work just fine, but if it does n't (kde; developers do n't test that case often), report it to http: / /bugs. kde. org and try running kdeinit before running & konqueror;; it usually helps.
Where does & konqueror; keep all its configuration data?
Generally in the ~/. kde folder (this may be ~/. kde3 on your system, depending on how & kde; 3 was installed). Do n't alter these files unless you really know what you are doing.
The ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqueror/ profiles folder holds individual files containing settings for each of your profiles.
Your bookmarks are held in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqueror/ bookmarks. xml
Cookies are held in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ kcookiejar/ cookies
Your history, as used for the auto-completion feature, is in ~/. kde/ share/ config/ konq_history
In the folder ~/. kde/ share/ config/ the files konqiconviewrc, konqlistviewrc and konquerorrc hold a whole lot of general configuration settings.
The folder ~/. kde/ share/ cache/ http/ contains the browser cache.
The Navigation Panel uses the files and subfolders in ~/. kde/ share/ apps/ konqsidebartng
Any folder specific view settings are put into. directory files in the individual folders.
How do I clear out the history file?
There are two histories:
One is used for text completion in the Location Toolbar text entry box. To clear this right click on the text entry box and select Clear History.
The other is the log of visited locations. Select the History page in the Navigation Panel, right click on an entry and choose Remove Entry to remove just that entry or Clear History to delete all entries.
How do I enable, disable or clear the browser cache?
If you select Cache in the dialog launched by selecting Settings Configure Konqueror..., you will be presented with a dialog box that lets you disable the cache, clear it or set its size, and change the caching policy.
In the Control Center Internet & Network Preferences page.
Take a look at http: / /www. konqueror. org/ faq. html or http: / /www. konqueror. org/ konq-java. html.
ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
& konqueror; the File Manager
In & UNIX; and & Linux; all folders are arranged in a simple hierarchy. Starting from a top level folder (also called the root directory), the structure descends and branches containing various files and subfolders. This means that you can get from any folder to any other by going up until you reach a common point then down through the appropriate subfolders until you reach your target.
The position of any file or folder in the structure (also called a directory tree) can be described by its path, which is a simple list of the folders you would have to descend through to get to the target folder or file. For example / home/ pam is the subfolder pam of the subfolder home of the top level folder, and / home/ pam/ words. txt is the file words. txt in that subfolder. The leading / in these paths represents the top level folder.
Every folder accessible by your system & mdash; including those on other hard disk partitions, your floppy and & CD-ROM; & mdash; will appear in the tree descending from /, their exact paths will depend on how your system was set up (see also the section on Floppy and & CD-ROM; Drives).
View Modes
Icon View
Tree View
Text View
File Size View
Checking the Show file tips box in the Behavior page of the & konqueror; Configuration dialog causes a small pop up information window to appear when the mouse pointer is hovered over a file or folder name or icon.
File Previews
Selecting View Preview from the Menubar will bring up a sub menu that lets you enable file previews for certain types of file.
Navigation
To move between folders you can simply step up and down the tree:
To descend into a subfolder left click on its name or icon -- or if you have already selected it (see below) -- then just press Enter.
To go up the folder tree you can click on the Up button in the Toolbar, use Alt; Up Arrow, or use the Menubar Go Up option.
To select a file or folder in the displayed folder without opening it in any way use the up and down arrow keys to move through the items. The selected item will be highlighted and some information about it will be displayed in the Status Bar.
You can go directly to any folder by typing its path into the Location Toolbar window or into the dialog box invoked by the Menubar Location Open Location item or by Ctrl; O. & konqueror; 's Text Completion feature may be useful when you do this. Do n't forget that in & Linux; / & UNIX; file and folder names are case sensitive.
When you have moved to a new folder you can go back to your previous choice by using the Toolbar Back button, the Menubar Go Back item, or Alt; Left Arrow. Once you have gone back you can go forward. Use the Toolbar Forward button, the Menubar Go Forward item or Alt; Right Arrow.
Alternatively, you can also choose to enter the parent folder by clicking on the Toolbar Up, the Go Up item, or with Alt; Up Arrow.
Holding the & LMB; pressed while the mouse pointer is over the Toolbar Up, Back or Forward buttons brings up a menu of recently visited locations.
Finding Files and Folders
If you do n't know or ca n't remember where a file or folder is within your system, then use the Toolbar Find File button or the Menubar Tools Find File... option. This will embed the file finder application & kfind; into & konqueror; 's window. See the & kfind; Handbook for help in using & kfind;.
If the name of a file or folder begins with a period (dot), then it is a hidden file or folder, and will not normally be shown by & konqueror;. To see hidden files or folders use the Menubar View Show Hidden Files option.
Floppy and & CD-ROM; Drives
Any floppy disk, & CD; drive or other hard disk partition that you have on your system will usually appear in the /, / media, / mnt or / auto folder, having a path something like / mnt/ floppy or / cdrom. The details will depend on how your system was set up.
& UNIX; / & Linux; requires that you mount a floppy disk or & CD-ROM; when you have inserted it into the drive, and mount other hard disk partitions when you want to access them. You also need to unmount a floppy disk or & CD-ROM; before removing it to register that it is no longer available.
How you do this will depend on how your system:
You may have an Automount facility, in which case you do n't have to bother about explicitly mounting and unmounting, although you may find that the & CD-ROM; occasionally starts up by itself for no apparent reason.
You may have Floppy, & CD-ROM; and hard disk icons on your desktop, in which case & LMB; click on the icon to mount it. Doing this should also bring up a & konqueror; window showing the contents of the floppy, & CD-ROM; or partition. To unmount, right click on the icon and choose the Unmount item. Visit the section Create New... in this Handbook to see how to create such an icon.
Or you can do it the traditional way by typing into a text console window:
to mount, for example, the floppy drive, and
to unmount it (umount not unmount).
Rather than having to open a text console to type the mount or umount commands, you may prefer to use & konqueror; 's Tools Execute Shell Command (Ctrl; E) feature.
Deleting Files and Folders
& konqueror; gives you two ways to dispose of an unwanted file or folder:
You can move it to the Trash folder, which is the safest method as you can get it back if you realize that you have made a mistake.
You can just plain Delete it, which removes the entry from the folder and adds the disk area occupied by the file(s) to the system's list of free disk areas, in the same way as the rm command.
The simplest way to remove a file or folder is to position the mouse pointer over its name or icon and press the & RMB;, which will bring up a menu containing the options Move to Trash and Delete.
Or, if you have selected the item, the Menubar Edit menu will give you the choice of Move to Trash and Delete options.
Del will move the selected item or items to Trash.
Shift; Del will really, truly and irrevocably delete the selected item or items.
You wo n't be able to remove a file or folder if you do n't have the necessary permissions; see the section on Super User Mode for further details.
Moving and Copying
To copy a file or subfolder between folders you can:
Position the mouse pointer over its name or icon and hold down the & RMB;, which will bring up a menu containing the Copy option. Choose that.
Or if the item is selected you can use the Copy button on the Toolbar or the Menubar Edit Copy item, or the Ctrl; C shortcut key combination. You can also select multiple files or folders to copy/ move as well.
Navigate to the folder you want to copy the item into then Paste the item into the new folder by using the Toolbar Paste button or the Menubar Edit Paste option or the Ctrl; V shortcut, or by moving the mouse pointer to a clear area of the window and holding the & RMB; down to bring up a menu containing the Paste option.
Moving a file or subfolder between folders can be done in the same way as copying, except that you choose the Cut option or Ctrl; X instead of Copy. The item that you have Cut will be removed from the original folder when you do the Paste into the new folder.
You can also copy or move selected item(s) to another folder by using Edit Copy Files (F7) or Edit Move Files (F8), or by selecting Copy To or Move To from the drop down menu you get when you right click on an file or folder name in the File Manager window.
You may not be able to copy or move a file or folder if you do n't have the necessary permissions. See the section on Super User Mode for further details.
Using Drag'n Drop
& konqueror; also supports Drag and Drop copying and moving of files and folders.
You can do this by having two instances of & konqueror;, one showing the folder you want to copy from, the other showing the target folder. Position the mouse pointer over the item you wish to copy or move, then, holding the & LMB; pressed, drag it to a clear space in the target folder. Release the button and you will be presented with a menu choice of Copy or Move. Take care to drop the item into an empty area of the target folder view - dropping it on top of another file name or icon can cause problems.
You can also set up & konqueror; to show more than one folder within its window and drag & drop between them.
Split Views for Drag & Drop
This screenshot illustrates the use of the Menubar Window Split View Left/ Right option, also available with the shortcut Ctrl; Shift; L, to split the main & konqueror; window into two views, each showing the contents of a different folder.
To be able to show different folders in each view they should not be linked; the little boxes at the bottom right of each view should be empty.
The active view, that is the one whose path is shown in the Location Toolbar and which responds to navigation and Menubar commands, is shown by the little green light in the bottom left corner. To make a view active, left click on an empty area of the view or on its Status Bar.
To remove an active view from & konqueror; 's window use the Ctrl; Shift; R shortcut, or the Menubar Window Remove Active View option, or & RMB; click on the Status Bar and choose the Remove Active View option from the resulting menu.
Selecting Multiple Files
You sometimes want to delete, copy or move a number of files that are similar in some way. For example you may wish to move all of the. png graphics files from one folder to another. & konqueror; makes this easy by letting you select multiple files based on similarities in their file names.
Use the Menubar Edit Selection Select... item or the shortcut Ctrl; +. This brings up a little dialog box in which you enter a filename containing the wildcard characters *, which matches any number of characters, and? which matches a single character. Press OK and & konqueror; will highlight all files with matching names. For example;
flag*. png will select all filenames starting with the letters flag and ending with. png.
memo?. txt will select memo1. txt and memo9. txt but not memo99. txt.
When you have selected a range of files, you can narrow down the selection by using the Menubar Edit Unselect... option or Ctrl; - to specify which of the selected files should be removed from the selection.
Use Ctrl; U or the Menubar Edit Unselect All option or just & LMB; click on a clear area of the view to cancel the selection.
You can even invert the selection: that is, deselect all selected files and select those that were previously unselected. Use the Menubar Edit Invert Selection option or Ctrl; * to do this.
Toggle the current selection.
Ctrl; Up Arrow, Ctrl; Down Arrow, Ctrl; Home, Ctrl; End, Ctrl; Page Up, Ctrl; Page Down
Once you have selected the right files then the normal delete, copy or move commands will act on all of the selected files at once.
Depending on your keyboard type and locale, you may find that the Ctrl; +, Ctrl; - and Ctrl; * shortcuts only work with the Numeric keypad +, - and * keys.
Create New
When & konqueror; is in File Manager mode, picking Create New from the Edit menu or from the context menu you get by & RMB; clicking on a free area in a folder view gives you a submenu letting you create any of the following in the current folder:
This option is most useful if you want to create an icon that will open a particular application. It opens a dialog box with three tabbed pages. The first, General, is where you choose an icon and the text that will appear with it. The second page, Permissions, lets you select who can use or modify the icon. In the Application page you must enter the Command that will run the application, for example, kedit to start up the & kedit; text editor. kedit / home/ pam/ todo. txt would open the file / home/ pam/ todo. txt in & kedit;. Advanced options such as the file types which the application can open are also available from this page.
To make the application icon appear on your desktop, create the link in your ~/ Desktop folder (this may be called something slightly different depending on how & kde; was installed on your system) or get to the Create New... sub menu by right clicking on a free area of the desktop instead of within & konqueror; 's window.
If you have a lot of specialized application links and do n't want to clutter up the desktop, then why not create them in your Applications folder. You can get there in & konqueror; by choosing Go Applications. Then create a single icon on your desktop to open your Applications folder, which is usually in ~/. kde/ share/ applnk.
To put an application link icon into the panel, first create it in the Applications folder then drag the icon onto a clear area of the panel.
This lets you create an icon to open & konqueror; at a particular folder or web page. As with Link To Application... you can make the application icon appear on your desktop by creating the link in your ~/ Desktop folder or going to the Create New... sub menu by right clicking on a free area of the desktop. When you first create it the text shown with the icon will be the full path or & URL;. You can change it by right clicking on the icon, selecting Properties... and entering the preferred text in the General tab page.
Use this option to create an icon that will mount a floppy disk and open an instance of & konqueror; showing the disk's contents. To unmount the disk when you have finished with it right click on the icon and select Unmount. In practice it does n't have to be a floppy disk but can be any hard disk or partition on your system that is not normally mounted. However, in most cases you will want to create the icon on your desktop.
This option is similar to Floppy Device... but for a hard disk drive or partition.
CD/ DVD-ROM Device...
This option is similar to Floppy Device... but for a CD or DVD drive.
An easy way of creating a new (sub)folder.
Text File...
Use this to create an ordinary, empty, text file. A dialog box will be opened for you to enter the name of your new file.
HTML File...
Creates a skeleton HTML source file. When you type the new file's name into the dialog box it is probably best to give it a. html extension to avoid confusion.
Presentation Document...
Creates a skeleton & koffice; & kpresenter; document. Give its name a. kpr extension.

Use this to create a new KOffice & kspread; spreadsheet file, and name it with a. ksp extension.
Illustration Document...
Creates a new KOffice & kontour; document. Name it with the extension. kil.
Changing Names and Permissions
The two easiest ways to change the name of a file or folder is to either right click on it and select Rename, or select the file or folder and then press the F2 button.
To change the name or permissions of a file or folder right click on its name or icon and select the Properties... item, or if you have selected the file or folder, then you can use the Menubar Edit Properties option.
This will bring up the Properties dialog box with two tabbed pages:
General, which gives you some information about the item and lets you change its name and, for a folder, the associated icon.
Permissions, which shows you the item's ownership and access permissions and lets you change the permissions.
Copy and Rename
Super User Mode
If you are running as a normal user and try to access files outside of your own home folder you will often be prevented from doing so and get an error message such as Access Denied.
To access these files you need to be logged in as the system administrator, often known as the Super User or root.
Rather than logging out then in again, you can launch & konqueror; from the K Menu in Super User mode by selecting System File Manager - Super User Mode. You will be asked for the root login password but as long as you can provide that & konqueror; will be started up with full access privileges to all files on your system.
Take care. As Super User (root), you have complete control of your system, and a wrong command can easily do irrevocable damage.
Also, connecting to the internet as root is an extremely bad idea, as it seriously increases your vulnerability to malicious hacking.
At the Command Line
Although & konqueror; is a very powerful and flexible GUI file manager, there are occasions when the experienced & Linux; / & UNIX; user wants to get down to the basics and work at the text command line level.
You can, of course, open an instance of & konsole;, perhaps with & konqueror; 's Menubar Tools Open Terminal option or with Ctrl; T.
If you only want to launch a program or view a & URL;, the Tools Run Command (Alt; F2) option may be easier.
For more complex operations, & konqueror; has another nice feature: the Menubar Settings Show Terminal Emulator option, which opens up a terminal window as a new view within & konqueror;. As long as the link icon is visible at the bottom right corner of each view, the terminal will follow any folder changes you make in the normal file manager view.

Plugins
& Netscape; Plugins
Currently, & konqueror; supports & Netscape; 4. x plugins.
Selecting Settings Configure Konqueror... Plugins will give you a dialog box with two tabbed pages; Scan and Plugins.
The Scan page controls how & kde; scans for new & Netscape; plugins, either manually by pressing the Scan for New Plugins button or automatically each time & kde; starts up.
The scan is done by looking through the folders listed in the Scan Folders list for. so files containing plugin code. It examines every such file to find out which MIME types the plugin supports. It then creates MIME type definitions for & kde; in the user's ~/. kde/ share/ mimelnk folder to make other applications aware of them.
The Plugins page shows you the & Netscape; plugins that & kde; has found, and for each plugin it lists the MIME types and the filename suffixes it uses to recognize them.
& konqueror; Plugins
The package kdeaddons contains several useful plugins that interact with & konqueror; in various ways. These are explained briefly below, more detailed information may be obtained by looking through the Konqueror Plugins section in the & kde; Help Center.

Saving Settings & Profiles
When you close down & konqueror; your current View menu settings (such as the View Mode, Use index. html and Show Hidden Files items) are not automatically saved as the default options; however, you can have & konqueror; remember these settings by selecting Settings Save View Profile "Web Browsing"... and the current setting will become the default option to be used the next time & konqueror; is started.
But you can also specify different View menu settings for an individual folder. To do this check the View Properties Saved in Folder box in the Settings menu, change the View settings to whatever you want then uncheck the View Properties saved in Folder box. Doing this creates a. directory file in that folder to hold the folder View settings. Use the Settings Remove Folder Properties option to remove the folder specific settings (or just delete the. directory file).
One nice use of this feature is if you have a folder full of pictures. You can set that particular folder to display thumbnails of the pictures (by choosing Icon View and Preview Show Previews from the View menu) when you open it, while not displaying images as thumbnails in other folders.
You can create a desktop icon to start & konqueror; with your new profile. First create a desktop icon by dragging the & konqueror; icon from the K menu onto the desktop and selecting Copy Here. Then right click on the new icon, select Properties... and change Program Name in the Execute tab page to kfmclient openProfile MyNewProfile, MyNewProfile being what you called the new profile.

This document is the user handbook for the & konsole; application.
& UNIX; operating systems were originally designed as text-only systems, controlled by keyboard commands -- what is known as a command-line interface (CLI). The & X-Window; and & kde; and other projects have since added the graphical interface you are now using. However, the underlying CLI system is still there, and is frequently the easiest, fastest and most powerful way to perform many tasks.
& konsole; is what is known as an X terminal emulator, often referred to as a terminal or a shell. It gives you the equivalent of an old-fashioned text screen on your desktop, but one which can easily share the screen with your graphical applications. & Windows; users may be familiar with the MS-DOS Prompt utility, which has the analogous function of offering a DOS command-line under & Windows;. (Although the & UNIX; CLI s offer far more power and ease of use than does DOS!)
Explaining the use of the & UNIX; CLI is beyond the scope of this document, as it would require a lengthy book. Fortunately, many such books are available in every language in any good bookstore or library. There are also tutorials available on the Internet. Enjoy & kde;, but do n't be shy about learning to use the command-line! You will find that even learning just the basics will make your computer use much more efficient and enjoyable.
What makes & konsole; special?
& konsole; 's advanced features include simple configuration and the ability to use multiple terminal shells in a single window, making for a less cluttered desktop.
Using & konsole;, a user can open:
& Linux; console sessions
Shell sessions
Screen sessions
Midnight Commander file manager sessions
Root console sessions
Root Midnight Commander sessions
User created sessions
These sessions can be renamed to help you keep track of all your shells, or signaled (STOP, CONT, HUP, INT, TERM, KILL).
For more control over & konsole;, a user can:
hide/ show the menubar and/ or frame
select the size of a & konsole; window, fonts, color schemes, and key mapping
change location of the scrollbar or hide the scrollbar
change location of the tabbar or hide the tabbar
All chosen settings can be made the default for forthcoming sessions by saving them.
For those with a deep interest in the taxonomy of free X terminals, there are two others of this kind: xterm, the original, written even before X itself (a month or two), and xvt, a lightweight xterm clone, on which most other currently available derivatives (notably eterm) are based.
Startup
When & konsole; is started, an application (typically a & UNIX; shell) runs in the window. Simply type at the prompt.

Configuring & kde;
How do I set the language used by & kde;?
There are two ways to set the language & kde; uses in the messages it will display:
Using the kde; Control Center
Fire up the kde; Control Center and select Regional & Accessibility followed by Country/ Region & Language. You can select your language and location here. If & kde; cannot find a translation in the first language chosen, it will fall back on the default language. This is usually (American) English by default.
Using the kde; Control Center is the preferred way of choosing languages in & kde;.
Using the KDE_LANG environment variable
The second method uses the standard locale setting on your system. To change the language, simply set the environment variable KDE_LANG accordingly. For example, if your shell is bash, execute export KDE_LANG =de to set German as the language used.
Is there any keyboard switcher for international keyboards for & kde;?
Yes, you can configure it using the kde; Control Center Regional & Accessibility Keyboard Layout configuration page.
How do I replace the standard text login screen with the & kde; login screen?
First, you need to change to the xdm runlevel (runlevel 5 on & RedHat; and & SuSE; systems) by editing your / etc/ inittab file. In the file, you should have a line saying id:3: initdefault:. Change it to id:5: initdefault:. Now, at the end of the file, comment out the following line: x:5: respawn: / usr/ bin/ X11/ xdm -nodaemon and replace it with x:5: respawn: / opt/ kde/ bin/ kdm -nodaemon.
The location of & kdm; may differ on your system.
For changes to take effect immediately, type init 5 (for & RedHat; systems) at the shell prompt.
It is risky to initiate a graphical login without checking beforehand whether it works. If it fails to work, you would be in for a hard time getting back....
Where do I find information regarding & kde; themes?
How do I change & MIME; Types?
If you are using & konqueror;, do this instead: first, open a & konqueror; window and choose Settings Configure Konqueror, then File Associations. Find the type you want to change (eg; text/ english or image/ gif), and set the application preference order to whatever you want.
& kde; (kdm;) does not read my. bash_profile!
The login managers xdm and & kdm; do not run a login shell, so. profile,. bash_profile, & etc; are not sourced. When the user logs in, xdm runs Xstartup as root and then Xsession as user. So the normal practice is to add statements in Xsession to source the user profile. Please edit your Xsession and. xsession files.
How do I use & TrueType; fonts in & kde;?
You need to install & TrueType; font support into your & X-Window; configuration. Please take a look at x. themes. org for the fonts, and xfsft: & TrueType; Font Support For X11 or X-TrueType; Server Project Home Page for the font servers.
If you have a bunch of & TrueType; fonts from & Microsoft; & Windows;, edit the xorg. conf file to get the fonts from the font folder. Then just tell & kde; to use these new fonts with the font administrator utility.
Is it possible to enter, show and work with the Euro Symbol in & kde;?
Yes and no. For details, look here: http: / /www. koffice. org/ kword/ euro. php.
I would like to click the & LMB; anywhere on the desktop and have the K menu displayed.
Open the kde; Control Center and choose Desktop Behavior. You can now choose the behavior of mouse clicks on the desktop. To have the K menu open from a single & LMB; click, change the entry labeled Left button to say Application Menu.
Contributing
How can I contribute to & kde;?
& kde; is a free software project that lives from voluntary contributions. Everybody is encouraged to contribute to & kde;. Not only programmers are welcome. There are many ways in which you can help to improve & kde;:
Test the software.
Send in bug reports. For more information on this, see How do I submit a bug report?.
Write documentation or help files. You can get some information by visiting the kde; Editorial Team Home Page.
Translate programs, documentation, and help files. For more information on this, you should visit The & kde; Translators' and Documenters' Web Site.
Draw nice icons or compose sound effects. You can visit the kde; artists page to find out more.
Write articles and books about & kde;. If you want to help spread the word about & kde;, simply send an email to kde-promo@kde. org. This will get you in touch with the & kde; public relations volunteers.
Program new & kde; applications. Please refer to for more information.
Of course, sponsors are also welcome.: -)
There are several places to look for more information if you want to get involved in the development. The first step is to subscribe to some of the mailing lists. You will soon see something that can be improved or added.
How do I submit a bug report?
There is a bug tracking system available at http: / /bugs. kde. org. The system features a wizard to submit new bug reports and a list of all known bugs.
The easiest way to submit a bug is to select Help Report Bug... from the menu bar of the application with the bug. This will open a small dialog box with a link to the bug tracking system. Please make sure to follow the instructions of the bug reporting wizard.
I want to program for & kde;. What should I do first?
Everybody is encouraged to develop software for & kde;. What you should do first depends strongly on your experience, & eg; whether you have already learned C++ or have experience with the & Qt; toolkit and so on.
To get into & kde; programming, you will need some basic tools: cmake, and gcc. You should look to http: / /techbase. kde. org/ for more tips.
Another excellent resource for learning & kde; programming is the & Qt; online tutorials. These are installed along with & Qt;. To view them, open $QTDIR / doc/ html/ index. html in & konqueror; and bookmark it. The tutorials can be found under "Using Qt". The source code for each lesson can be found in the $QTDIR / tutorial directory.
There is, however, one thing that everybody interested in programming for & kde; should do: subscribe to the developers mailing list. To subscribe, you have to send an email to kde-devel-request@kde. org with the subject subscribe your_email_address.
Please read How to subscribe/ unsubscribe to these lists carefully. Everything said there applies to the development list as well.
How do I get access to & kde; SVN?
The & kde; project uses SVN to develop the core parts of the software. Usually, when you have changed one of the parts (eg; fixed a bug), and you want to commit this change, the best way is to create a patch against a current snapshot and send this patch to the developer/ maintainer of the respective program.
If you are doing this more or less regularly, there are instructions here on how to get write access to the SVN repository: http: / /techbase. kde. org/ Contribute/ Get_a_SVN_Account. But be aware that more users will slow down SVN access for all developers, so we want to keep the number of people with direct SVN access reasonably small. But feel free to ask!
Can I have read-only access to the SVN repository?
Yes. Instructions on how to get anonymous, read-only SVN access are here: http: / /techbase. kde. org/ Getting_Started/ Sources/ Anonymous_SVN
Are there any SVN mirror sites for & kde;?
How do I go about translating & kde; programs into my native language?
Look at the The & kde; Translators' and Documenters' Web Site to see whether your program is already translated (most are). Otherwise you will find information there on how to do it yourself.
The desktop
How do I add an application to the desktop?
Just choose the desired application from the K menu and drag and drop it to the Desktop.
For applications not listed in the K menu, use the & RMB; on the desktop and choose Create New Link to Application... and fill in the configuration for the application you want to link to.
How do I mount/ unmount a device from the desktop?
First, make sure you are allowed to mount / umount the relevant device as a user.
Where are the icons kept?
The icons can be found only in $KDEDIRS / share/ icons or $HOME /. kde/ share/ icons. To use icons stored in other locations, you must either copy them into one of the above-mentioned fixed & kde; locations or make symlinks.
How do I use the mouse scroll wheel in & kde;?
Mouse wheel support comes with & Qt; 2.0 and above, so & kde; based on that will automatically support the use of the mouse scroll wheel if your system is configured correctly. Check that your & X-Server; settings support the use of a scrollwheel if it is not working.
How do I launch applications in a particular desktop?
& kde; comes with a program called & kstart;. To start an xterm on the second desktop and then activate it use: kstart --desktop 2 --activate --window "xterm" xterm.
Please read kstart --help-all for more magic available with & kstart; (and there is an abundance).
Where do I save my files if I want them to appear directly on the desktop?
$HOME / Desktop. You might need to refresh your desktop after you have saved your files.
The File Manager
& kde; 's file manager is & konqueror;. The & konqueror; home page is located at http: / /www. konqueror. org where a & konqueror; specific FAQ can be found.
How can I change the appearance of a folder in & konqueror;?
How can I do non-anonymous & FTP; transfers with & konqueror;?
Normally, if you enter a & URL; like ftp: / / ftp. example. com, & konqueror; will attempt an anonymous login to the & FTP; server. If you want to login as a particular user, enter a & URL; like ftp: / / username@ftp. example. com instead. & konqueror; will ask for your password and connect to the server.
How do I specify the startup folder for & konqueror;?
Using the & RMB;, click on the Home icon and choose Properties. Under the Application tab you will probably find something like kfmclient openProfile filemanagement; just append file: / whereever/ you/ want with the folder you would like & konqueror; to start in.
How do I rename files?
Simply right click on the file and select Rename or press the keyboard shortcut F2 with a file selected.
How do I configure the programs that & konqueror; uses to open different types of files?
In the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Peripherals Mouse and in the General tab, select Double-click to open files and folders.
In & konqueror;, go to Settings Configure Konqueror and then to the File Associations page.
What are %i and %m in the Execute line?
They are used by all & kde; applications (since they are implemented in KApplication and all good & kde; programs create a KApplication object before they even look at the command line arguments).
A standard line for a & kde; application looks like this: foo... %i %m -caption \\"%c\\ ". Pretty confusing, -but it has been designed in that way so that it can integrate legacy, non-kde; applications as smoothly as possible. & konqueror;, when executing the line above, will extend the command to foo -icon something. png -miniicon something_mini. png -caption \\"The Foo\\". Both the icon and the mini-icon as well as "The Foo" are properties defined in the. desktop file. If the icons are not defined, they simply default to the executable name foo.
This way a user can change these things in & kmenuedit; for his or her applications. The -caption option is important, because no user will accept that the menu item Editor starts something called kedit-0.9pl4-build47. Instead, he expects a window called Editor. Furthermore these names are localized, i. e. an American user launches CD-Player and gets a window called CD-Player while a German user launches CD-Spieler and gets a window called CD-Spieler.
Getting & kde;
Where do I get & kde;?
The main distribution site for & kde; is ftp. kde. org. However, this site is often under heavy load, so you might prefer to use download. kde. org which automatically redirects you to the mirror nearest to you. You can also have a look at the list of & kde; mirror sites.
Are there & Linux; distributions that include & kde;?
Yes, major & Linux; distributions already ship & kde;. As building a distribution takes some time, they might not always contain the latest version, but for a start or to avoid downloading from the Internet, they do provide a good starting point.
You can find an up-to-date list of distributions that ship with & kde; here.
What is the current version?
Currently, the latest stable version is 4.2.1
The kde; 4.2.1 Info Page contains a lot of information specific to this release.
Where do I find & kde; snapshots?
You can get the latest snapshots from ftp: / /ftp. kde. org/ pub/ kde/ unstable/ snapshots. You might also want to consider setting up your own SVN client in order to maintain the latest snapshot at all times. Please refer to Anonymous SVN and & kde; for further information.
Where do I get & Qt;?
& Qt; is a product of the Norwegian company Trolltech. You can always get the latest & Qt; version from their FTP; server.
And with most up-to-date & Linux; distributions, & Qt; is already included. Please see for the version of & Qt; you need.
Installation instructions
These are the generic installation instructions for the K Desktop Environment. Please complement your reading with the README s and INSTALL s that come along with the package. Please read them carefully and try to help yourself out if anything goes wrong. If you need further assistance, consider joining the & kde; mailing lists (see our web site instructions for joining the & kde; mailing lists) or newsgroups.
To the would-be converts
So you have heard the rumors. Or you have seen the screenshots. And you are dying to get hold of & kde;. But you know next to nothing about this whole alternative OS business. Do n't worry! You only need to do some (well, maybe not some) reading, that's all!
& kde; does not run on any version of & Microsoft; & Windows; or OS/ 2 (yet). To run & kde;, you need to have a & UNIX; system. Please refer to for more details.
Decide on a platform and set it up for your system. This FAQ can not help you with this, since & kde; runs on many & UNIX; platforms.
Finally, you are ready to commence the & kde; installation. Please start reading from the next section. To get & kde;, please refer to. Last but not least, if you encounter any problems while installing & kde;, please do not hesitate to make use of the & kde; mailing lists and newsgroups. But do bear this in mind: no question is too silly to ask, but some are too silly to answer, especially when they are already answered in this FAQ.
Good luck and have fun!
Available package formats
You can find several kinds of binary and source packages for different distributions and operating systems on the & kde-ftp;. The binary packages are not made by the & kde; Team, but by the distributors themselves, or some dedicated individuals. Please refer to kde; Package Policy Explained for information about the & kde; Package Policy. The only official release is the source tar. bz2 packages. Please refer to the README s and INSTALL s in the several binaries folders. For a list of the available packages for a release, refer to the relevant info page. For the latest release this is the kde; 3.4.1 Info Page.
Prerequisites
For & kde; 3.4.1, you need the & Qt; library version 3.3 or greater. Please make sure you download the correct & Qt;. You will also need the header files, if you want to compile & kde; yourself. They are all available, at no cost, from http: / /www. trolltech. com/ download. In addition, there are optional libraries that might improve & kde; if installed on your system. An example is OpenSSL which will enable & konqueror; to browse web pages securely and is needed in a version > =0.9.6. These should be provided by your distributor; if not, ask for an update.
Description of the base packages
The base distribution currently consists of twenty packages. Some are required, while others are optional. Each package is available in each of the aforementioned package formats.
kdelibs
Required
This package contains shared libraries that are needed by all & kde; applications.

& arts; and then kdelibs should be installed before everything else, and kdeaddons last. The other packages can be installed in any arbitrary order.
Installation instructions for the different package formats
Please do not forget to read the README and INSTALL files if they are available.
Installation of the Debian packages
The Debian packages install in accordance with the upcoming FHS (File Hierarchy Standard).
become superuser
run dpkg -i packagename. deb for every package you want to install.
Installation of the RPM packages
To install binary RPM s
execute rpm -ivh packagename. rpm
Installation of the source. tar. bz2 files
Since there are always changes and updates to the way & kde; is compiled, please refer to Download and Install from Source for the most up to date installation instructions for the source packages.
The general approach should work in most cases though.
The source. tar. bz2 package installs into / usr/ local/ kde by default. You can override this setting by using the --prefix option of the configure script.
unpack the packages with tar jxvf packagename. tar. bz2
change folder to the package folder: cd packagename
configure the package:. / configure
Some packages (notably kdebase) have special configuration options that might be applicable to your installation. Type. / configure --help to see the available options.
build the package: make
install the package: su -c "make install" (if you are n't already root). If you already are, just type make install.
Post-installation procedures
First of all, please make sure that you have added & kde; 's binary installation folder (eg; / usr/ local/ kde/ bin) to your PATH and & kde; 's library installation folder to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (only necessary on systems that do not support rpath; on & Linux; & ELF;, it should work without). This environment variable may be called differently on some systems, & eg; it is called SHLIB_PATH on & IRIX;. Then set the environment variable KDEDIR to the base of your & kde; tree, & eg; / usr/ local/ kde.
Please bear in mind that it is unwise to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH blindly. In the vast majority of cases it is unnecessary and can do more harm than good. There is a web page written by Dave Barr explaining the evils of LD_LIBRARY_PATH and it can be found at http: / /www. visi. com/ ~barr/ ldpath. html.
Even though you can use most of the & kde; applications simply by calling them, you can only benefit fully from & kde; 's advanced features if you use the & kde; window manager and its helper programs.
In order to make it easy for you, we have provided a simple script called startkde which gets installed in $KDEDIR / bin and is therefore in your path.
Edit the file. xinitrc in your home folder (make a backup copy first!), remove everything that looks like calling a window manager, and insert startkde instead. Restart the & X-Server;. If you use & kdm; / xdm, you will have to edit the file. xsession instead of. xinitrc. And if there is no. xinitrc or. xsession in your home folder, simply create a new one with just one line containing startkde.
Some systems (notably & RedHat; & Linux;) use. Xclients instead.
This should present you with a new shining & kde; desktop. You can now start to explore the wonderful world of & kde;. In case you want to read some documentation first, there is a highly recommended Quick Start guide available. Furthermore, every application has an online help that is available via the help menu.
Should I remove old version xyz before installing a new one?
In principle, this is not necessary. RPM and Debian packages should take care of all dependencies.
How do I start & kde;?
The most comfortable method to start & kde; is to use the startkde script. Simply put the line startkde at the end of your. xsession file (or your. xinitrc or. Xclients file if you are not using & kdm; or xdm). Please also remove the lines that start your previous window manager. If there is no. xsession,. xinitrc, or. Xclients in your home folder, simply create a new one that contains just one line: startkde.
Is it possible to install & kde; in a user folder?
Yes, you can install & kde; in any folder you want. What you have to do depends on the kind of packages you want to install:
Source packages
Configure and install the package using configure --prefix= / users/ myhome/ kde; make; make install to install into / users/ myhome/ kde.
Add the following to your init files. Please note that if it is not necessary for you to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, it is better to leave it out.
For csh or tcsh:
setenv KDEDIR / users/ myhome/ kde if ($? LD_LIBRARY_PATH) then setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $KDEDIR/ lib: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH else setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $KDEDIR/ lib endif if (! $? LIBRARY_PATH) then setenv LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH endif
For bash:
KDEDIR=/ users/ myhome/ kde PATH=$KDEDIR/ bin: $PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KDEDIR/ lib: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH export KDEDIR PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH LIBRARY_PATH
RPM packages
rpm allows you to use the --prefix option to select the folder you want to install to. For example, executing rpm -i --prefix= / users/ myhome/ kde package. rpm will install the package to / users/ myhome/ kde.
Although & kde; will run from a user folder, there are some problems with programs that require suid root, & eg; the programs in the kdeadmin package. But since they are not meant to be run by users in the first place, this is nothing to worry about.
However, on systems using shadow passwords, the screensavers have to be suid root to enable password access for unlocking the screen, so this option will not work.
startkde fails with can not connect to X server. What is wrong?
You probably tried to start the X server with startkde. The X server is started with startx. startkde is the script that should be run from your. xinitrc,. xsession, or. Xclients to activate the window manager and the necessary server daemons for & kde;. See also.
& kde; on & AIX;?
& kde; on a laptop?
If you can get & X-Window; to run on your laptop, you should not have any problem getting & kde; to run on it. In addition, you might find the following links helpful:
http: / /www. linux-laptop. net/
http: / /www. sanpei. org/ Laptop-X/ note-list. html
I do not like the default & kde; folder after installation. How do I move it without breaking anything?
Assuming the default is / opt/ kde and you want to move it to / usr/ local/ kde, here's what you have to do:
change to superuser if you are n't already
mv / opt/ kde / usr/ local/ kde
ln -s / usr/ local/ kde / opt/ kde
This will put all your & kde; files in / usr/ local/ kde but everything is still accessible from / opt/ kde.
What files can I delete from my & kde; install folder? Can all the *. h, *. c and *. o files be safely removed?
There should not be any need to keep the. c and. o files, but you might want to keep the. h files, as they are used by includes if you ever want to compile your own & kde; programs. But if you wish to add patches to the source programs as they become available (rather than downloading everything again), then they should stay.
Will I lose my current settings when I upgrade & kde;?
Settings are kept in the $HOME /. kde or $HOME /. kde2 subfolder in your home folder. Copy your old. kde /. kde2 folder to a backup location, install & kde; 3.2, and then copy back any necessary mail and news settings. That said, most people can make a direct upgrade, without removing the old. kde folder, without a hitch.
~/. kde/ socket- hostname
/ tmp/ tmp-kde- USER
/ tmp/ ksocket- USER
Compiling kdebase gives me a bin/ sh: msgfmt: command not found error!
You need the & GNU; msgfmt which is part of the & GNU; i18n package gettext. You should be able to download it from any & GNU; mirror.
How do I uninstall & kde; applications compiled from source?
You can uninstall your programs by typing make uninstall in the folder where you did make install. If you have already deleted that folder, then there is only one way, and it is not good: go to $KDEDIR / bin and start deleting files one by one.
What is up with & GIF; support?
This has to do with issues with Unisys' & LZW; patent. & GIF; support is turned off from & Qt; 1.44 onwards by default. When you want to use & GIF; s and have the relevant license, recompile & Qt; with & GIF; support.. / configure -gif.
Introduction
What is & kde;?
& kde; is the K Desktop Environment. It is a project initiated by Matthias Ettrich in 1996. The aim of the & kde; project is to connect the power of the & UNIX; operating systems with the comfort of a modern user interface.
In short, & kde; will bring & UNIX; to the desktop!
If you want further information about & kde;, have a look at What is & kde;?
On which platforms can I expect & kde; to work?
& kde; is a Desktop Environment for all flavors of & UNIX;. While it is true that most & kde; developers use & Linux;, & kde; runs smoothly on a wide range of systems. You may, however, need to tweak the source code a bit to get & kde; to compile on a not-so-popular variant of & UNIX;, or if you are not using the & GNU; development tools, in particular the & gcc; compiler.
Is & kde; a window manager?
No, & kde; is not a window manager. While & kde; includes a very sophisticated window manager (kwin;), & kde; is much more than that. It is a full-blown Integrated Desktop Environment.
& kde; provides a complete desktop environment, including a web browser, a file manager, a window manager, a help system, a configuration system, uncountable tools and utilities, and an ever increasing number of applications, including but not limited to mail and news clients, drawing programs, a & PostScript; and a & DVI; viewer and so forth.
Is & kde; a CDE, & Windows; or & Mac; OS clone?
No, & kde; is not a clone. Specifically & kde; is not a CDE or & Windows; clone. While the & kde; developers have and will continue to glean the best features from all existing desktop environments, & kde; is a truly unique environment that has and will continue to go its own way.
Is & kde; free software?
Yes, & kde; is free software according to the & GNU; General Public License. All & kde; libraries are available under the LGPL making commercial software development for the & kde; desktop possible, but all & kde; applications are licensed under the GPL.
& kde; uses the Qt; C++ crossplatform toolkit, which is also released (since version 2.2) under the GPL and since version 4.5.0 also under the LGPL.
It is absolutely legal to make & kde; and & Qt; available on & CD-ROM; free of charge. No runtime fees of any kind are incurred.
& kde; applications
& kppp;
Many & kde; users report problems using & kppp;. But before you complain about & kppp;, make sure you have already checked the following:
Can you dialup to your ISP without using & kppp;? If you cannot, then perhaps & kppp; is not the culprit after all.
Have you gone through the & kppp; documentation at least three times and followed its instructions and trouble-shooting suggestions?
The & kppp; documentation can be accessed through the kde; Help Center. Last, but not least, the & kppp; homepage is at http: / /ktown. kde. org/ ~kppp/.
Now, if you still encounter problems, here's what might help you solve them:
How do I change the & MTU; setting in & kppp;?
Open up the & kppp; dialog box and select Setup. Choose an existing account and click Edit, or New to create a new dialup account. Select the Dial tab and click Arguments. Type what you want to change in the Argument textbox (eg; mtu 296) and click Add. When you are satisfied, click Close.
To check whether the options took, do one of the following:
In a terminal window, run / sbin/ ifconfig ppp0 and look at the reported & MTU; in the output. It should match your request.
Add debug and kdebug (each on a separate line) to your / etc/ ppp/ options file and restart your & PPP; session. You will find debugging messages in / var/ log/ messages, including & MRU; and & MTU; settings.
If you want, the & MRU; and & MTU; settings can be added to the options file, one complete setting per line, no quotes or dashes.
& kppp; connects at a slower speed than normal.
The following might do the trick:
Try executing setserial spd_hi.
The default & MTU; value is 1500, which maybe too large for a dialup connection. Try changing it to a smaller value like 296 or 576.
Check in your $HOME /. kde/ share/ config for the kppprc. Ensure the correct modem speed is actually defined there.
& konsole;
How do I page-up or page-down?
Use & Shift; Page Up and Shift; Pg Dn.
How do I perform a simple copy from & konsole; to anything else?
When I do a ls, first I select with the mouse the desired text, press Ctrl; C, then I make the target application active, point the mouse to the relevant part and press Ctrl; V. Alternatively, highlight the text by dragging with the & LMB; down and paste by clicking with the & MMB; (or both buttons if you are using a 2 button mouse with 3 button emulation).
& kmail;
& kmail; has its own home page at http: / /kmail. kde. org where a FAQ is available.
Miscellaneous questions
What about & kde; programs that do not have icons? How do I get them into the menu?
Use & kmenuedit;. To access it use the & RMB; on the K button and select Menu Editor.
Does & kde; have a graphical & FTP; client?
Yes, and it is none other than your favorite file manager, & konqueror;. You can drag and drop remote files into local folders.
How do I exit & kde;?
Simply click on the K button and select Logout. In addition, if you right click on an empty area of the desktop, you will be presented with a menu containing logout as one of the options.
Depending on your configuration of the & X-Window;, Ctrl; Alt; Backspace; might also do the trick by killing the X server, but its use prevents session management and cannot be recommended.
Is there a program that checks for new mails at my ISP if and only if I am online?
& korn; will do the job. If you are not connected, it will just sit there (idling).
Is it really necessary to upgrade to the latest version?
We recommend to always use the latest stable release. If you do n't, it will probably be difficult to get answers to your questions. If you have a problem with an old version, the answer will probably be Please upgrade and try again. Note that new versions also sometimes fix security problems.
How do I copy and paste in & kde;?
The simplest method is to use your mouse:
Highlight the text you want to copy by holding down the & LMB; and dragging across the text. This adds the selected text to the clipboard.
Go to the destination area; depending on your configuration, you might need to click it using the & LMB; to give it focus.
Click the & MMB; to paste. If you have a two button mouse and are emulating a three button mouse, push both buttons simultaneously.
How do I convert the default & RedHat; menus into a menu in the K menu?
Click on the K button and select System Appfinder.
What is SVN?
It stands for Subversion, and is a version control system. It is similar to CVS, but improves on it in many ways. It is used to maintain source code under development. It will keep multiple versions of things (handy if you broke something and have to back up and get a clean old version), and allows people remote access over the internet to pick up the latest source code and even to check in new files if they have permission. It is also open source (you pay for support if you want it), and since it is free it is the system of choice for people writing more free products, such as & kde;.
Does & kde; support dual screen (Xinerama)?
Yes, you need to have a multi-headed X server (eg; MetroX or XFree86 4.0 and above) and a & kde; > = 2.2.1
How do I check which version of & kde; I am using?
Fire up the & kcontrolcenter;. It comes up with an Info Screen including the version of & kde; The & kde; version is also included in the application's About dialog. You can also check from the command line with the command kde-config --version
How do I go about creating themes and icons?
How can I get to know about development updates?
You might want to subscribe to the various & kde; mailing lists available, especially kde-cvs, which lists all commits done to the & kde; CVS repository. Check http: / /lists. kde. org if you want to read without subscribing.
Getting more information
Where is the & kde; homepage?
The & kde; homepage is located at http: / /www. kde. org. If you prefer a local mirror, there are several to choose from. For a current list of web site mirrors sorted by location, please visit http: / /www. kde. org/ mirrors/ web. php.
Is there a & kde; mailing list?
There are several & kde; mailing lists. Each focuses on a different aspect of & kde;. Some are for developers, so they are not discussed in detail. Some of the more important lists that users might be interested in are:
kde
This is the main & kde; mailing list for general discussions.
kde-announce
This list is used to announce new versions of & kde; as well as new tools and applications.
kde-look
This is the list that deals with questions about look and feel, and general user interface considerations.
For the complete list of mailing lists available, please refer to http: / /www. kde. org/ mailinglists/.
Please note that it is not a good idea to ask questions which are already answered in this & FAQ;.
How do I subscribe/ unsubscribe to these lists?
To subscribe, send an email to list-request, that is:
kde-request@kde. org
kde-announce-request@kde. org
kde-look-request@kde. org
The email must contain subscribe your_email_address in the subject.
To unsubscribe, send an email to list-request, that is:
The email must contain unsubscribe your_email_address in the subject.
Never send subscribe/ unsubscribe request to the mailing lists directly! Use the list-request instead.
There is also a complete list of all & kde; -related mailing lists, and a web interface for subscribing and unsubscribing located at http: / /master. kde. org/ mailman/ listinfo.
Is there a mailing list archive?
Yes, there is a searchable mailing list archive hosted by Progressive Computer Concepts. The & URL; is http: / /lists. kde. org. There you will see a folder listing of the mailing lists. Note that you can only do a subject/ author search at this level. You probably will not find what you want doing this kind of search.
To do a body search, you have to enter one of the mailing lists. Just click on the folder you want to search (eg; kde or kde-devel) and then the pull-down menu by the search box will default to Body searches. To be thorough, you should probably search the kde, kde-linux, and kde-devel folders.
Is there a newsgroup about & kde;?
Yes, there is! It is at comp. windows. x. kde. In addition, there is also a German newsgroup at de. alt. comp. kde. Please note that it is not a good idea to ask questions which are already answered in this & FAQ;.
Are there any other & kde; -related & FAQ; s?
Yes. Here is a list of them:
aRts sound server documentation
& kde; with non-kde; applications
My non-kde; applications like & Emacs; and kterm are running amok with strange colors!
Start the kde; Control Center and in Appearance & Themes Colors uncheck the Apply colors to non-KDE applications checkbox and click Apply.
Not really & kde; -related, but frequently asked nevertheless.
How do I change the screen resolution?
Use Ctrl; Alt; + and Ctrl; Alt; - to cycle through the resolutions you have defined in XF86Config (maybe under / etc/ X11; poke around first). If you prefer to get your hands dirty, you can always edit the file directly. By placing your favorite resolution at the beginning (or making it the only one listed), & X-Window; will always start up with that resolution.
Always make a backup copy of your XF86Config file before you start editing it. Errors in this file can render & X-Window; unusable.
These instructions are only valid if you are running version 3.3. x of the XFree86 server. If you are running XFree86 4. x, you must consult with the XFree86(TM): Home Page.
How do I change the color depth?
There is no way you can do this on the fly. You can either start & X-Window; using startx -bpp number where number can be 8, 16, 24 or 32, depending on the depth you want. Alternatively, if you are using xdm / kdm;, you need to edit / etc/ X11/ xdm/ Xservers (may vary) and enter :0 local / usr/ X11R6/ bin/ X -bpp 16 for 16 bit color depth.
You can also edit the XF86Config file and add a line like DefaultColorDepth number to Section "Screen". The next time you start X, it will run with the newly-configured color depth.
What can I do if I am using a 2-button mouse?
Go buy a 3-button one, or use third button emulation. The third button is emulated by pressing both the & LMB; and the & RMB; together. You would need to enable Emulate3Buttons in your XF86Config file.
What is a "sticky" window?
In a virtual desktop environment with multiple virtual desktops, a "sticky" window will stay put on the screen when you switch between desktops, as if sticking to the glass of the screen. Xclock is a typical candidate for sticking, as you need to run only one instance of it, and it always stays with you.
How do I extract/ install diff files?
To generate a context-diff suitable for patching, use diff -u old-file new-file & gt; patchfile. To apply the diff to a file (i. e. "patch the file"), execute patch & lt; patchfile.
How do I get & Linux; to mount the floppy device for use with both DOS and ext2 formatted floppies?
Just specify the filesystem type as auto in / etc/ fstab. Auto detection works fine for DOS and ext2.
How do I start & kde; with the Num Lock on?
How do I take window or desktop screenshots?
Use & ksnapshot;.
Is there a tool to make webpages?
Yes, and there are a lot of them out there, including StarOffice, Netscape; Composer, and XEmacs. There are also many & kde; applications. To find the most current list, go to kde-apps. org: The Latest in & kde; Applications and search for web development. Try as many as possible and choose the one most suitable to your needs.
What do all those acronyms like AFAIK mean?
AAMOF: as a matter of fact AFAIK: as far as I know AISE: as I see it BFN: bye for now BION: believe it or not BRB: be right back BTW: by the way CMIIW: correct me if I am wrong FUD: fear, uncertainty, and doubt FWIW: for what it's worth FYI: for your information HTH: hope this helps IIRC: if I recall correctly IMHO: in my humble opinion LOL: laughing out loud MYOB: mind your own business PITA: pain in the ass ROTFL: rolling on the floor laughing RTFM: read the fine manual SOP: standard operating procedure TIA: thanks in advance YMMV: your mileage may vary
The panel
How do I add applications to the & kde; panel (kicker;)?
Is it possible to change the K button of the panel to another picture?
Useful tips
Reading documentation in & kde;
man: command for man pages. It even unpacks on the fly if the man pages are gzipped.
Or you can use the kde; Help Center if you are using & kde; 2. Simply start the kde; Help Center by clicking on the icon (the blue book with the yellow key) on the toolbar. Once the kde; Help Center has loaded, the window on the left will contain an entry called Unix manual pages. Click once on this entry, and you can browse through all the installed manual pages on your system.
Move or resize windows quickly
To move a window, use Alt; left mouse button. Alt; right mouse button will resize the window. Last but not least, Alt; middle mouse button raises/ lowers the window. The kde; Control Center allows you to change these mouse bindings.
Killing windows in & kde;
There is a standard keybinding (Ctrl; Alt; Esc;) that gives you a skull & crossbones cursor. Click that cursor on a window to kill it. The keybindings are viewable/ changeable from the kde; Control Center.
ps -aux _BAR_ more
kill -9 pid
The window manager
The default window manager provided by & kde; is the K Window Manager (kwin;). Please read The K Window Manager Handbook (which should be accessible from the kde; Help Center) for usage information.
Are there keyboard shortcuts for & kwin; operations?
Yes. Please refer to "The K Window Manager Handbook" for the list of shortcuts available.
Can I define my own set of keyboard shortcuts?
Yes. Launch the kde; Control Center and select Regional & Accessibility Keyboard Shortcuts to configure window manager bindings like maximizing windows, & etc;.
When I "iconify" a window, it disappears. Where does it go?
With many & X-Window; & GUI; s, the minimize button (a little dot) will erase the window that the program is running in and create, instead, an icon on the desktop. & kde; does not do this. Instead, when a window is iconified it is simply hidden (but the program is still running).
There are a few ways to access disappeared windows:
If you are running the taskbar part of & kicker;, you can choose to have a list of tasks displayed on your desktop. Iconified tasks will have their names displayed in gray.
If you click the & MMB; on the root window (ie;, the background of the desktop), & kwin; will give you a list of all available tasks.
How do I maximize windows only vertically or horizontally?
Provided your window is not already maximized, clicking on the maximize button with the & LMB; /MMB; /RMB; will maximize fully/ vertically/ horizontally respectively.
What is shading a window?
By shading a window we mean rolling up the window leaving just the title bar visible. You can do this by double clicking on the window title bar.
Technologies
IO Slave
IO Slaves enable & kde; applications to access remote resources as easily as local resources (making them network transparent). Remote resources (eg; files) might be stored on SMB shares or similar.
SMB kde;
KIO
The & kde; Input/ Output system which makes use of so-called IO Slaves.
IO Slave kde;
KParts
KParts is an embedding technology which allows & kde; applications to embed other & kde; applications. For example, the text view used by & konqueror; is a KPart.
KSycoca
KSycoca (kde; Sy stem Co nfiguration Ca che) is a configuration cache which, for example, guarantees fast access to the menu entries.
KBuildSycoca
XFree86
Antialiasing
If mentioned in context with & kde;, anti-aliasing often means the smoothing of the fonts visible on the screen. & Qt; version 2.3.0 or higher used together with XFree86 4. x makes this possible under & kde; as well.
kde; Qt;
& X-Server;
The & X-Server; represents a basic layer upon which the various & GUI; s like & kde; are built. It manages the basic mouse and keyboard input (from the local host as well as from remote hosts) and provides elementary graphic routines to draw rectangles and other primitives.
kde; GUI;
Applications
KBuildSycoca4 is a command line program and regenerates the so-called KSycoca. This is useful, for example, if some or all modules in & systemsettings; are missing.
KSycoca systemsettings;
This is the project and filename of the & kde; control center. & systemsettings; allows you to customize virtually every configuration option of & kde;.
konqueror;
& konqueror; is a web browser, picture viewer, file manager and more, and a core part of the & kde; project. You can find more information about & konqueror; at www. konqueror. org.
Desktop Terminology
Drag and Drop
This concept tries to replace many actions like copying files from one place to another by a certain mouse movement, & eg; clicking on an icon in a & konqueror; window, moving the mouse to another window while keeping the mouse button pressed, and releasing the mouse button (dropping the object) copies files.
GUI;
Abbreviation for G raphical U ser I nterface. Every desktop environment (like & kde;) is a & GUI;. Most & GUI; s feature mouse support and/ or windows to manage the programs.
kde;

& kde; Help System User Manual
& kde; Help System
The & kde; help system is designed to make accessing the common & UNIX; help systems (man and info) simple, as well as the native & kde; documentation (XML;).
All base & kde; applications come fully documented, thanks to the efforts of the Documentation team. If you are interested in helping with the documentation efforts, join the mailing list and write to the team at kde-doc-english@kde. org. No experience is required, just enthusiasm and patience.
If you would like to help translating & kde; documentation to your native language, review the information, including coordinators for each language team, on the Localization web site, and in the Contact section of this document.
Installation
& khelpcenter; is an integral part of the & kde; Base installation, and is installed with every copy of & kde;. It can be found in the kdebase-runtime package, and is available from the & kde-ftp;, or will be found in your operating system's kdebase-runtime package.
Invoking Help
& khelpcenter; can be called in several ways:
From the Help menu
The most common will probably be from within an application. Choose F1 Help Applicationapos; s Handbook to open that application's handbook.
Choose the big K in your panel, and select the Applications tab followed by selecting Help to open & khelpcenter;, which will open up to the default welcome page.
From the command line
& khelpcenter; may be started using a & URL; to display a file. & URL; s have been added for info and man pages also. You can use them as follows:
An application help file
khelpcenter help: / kedit
Opens the & kedit; help file, at the contents page.
A local & URL;
khelpcenter file: / usr/ local/ src/ qt/ html/ index. html
A Man page
khelpcenter man: / strcpy
An Info page
khelpcenter info: / gcc
Invoking khelpcenter with no parameters opens the default welcome page.
The & khelpcenter; interface
The & khelpcenter; interface consists of two panes of information.
The toolbar and menus are explained further in.
Documents contain their own navigation tools, enabling you to move either sequentially through a document, using Next, Previous, and Home links, or to move around in a less structured manner, using hyperlinks.
Links can take you to other parts of the same document, or to a different document, and you can use the Back (Left pointing arrow) or Forward (Right pointing arrow) icons on the toolbar to move through the documents you have viewed in this session.
The two panes display the contents of the help system, and the help files themselves, on the left and right respectively.
The Contents pane
The Contents pane in & khelpcenter; is displayed on the left hand side of the window. As you might expect, you can move the splitter bar, to make sure you can comfortably read the contents of either pane.
The Contents pane is further divided into two tabs, one containing a menu showing all the help information & khelpcenter; is aware of, and the other contains the & kde; glossary of terms.
The Contents Menu
The Contents contains the following default entries:
& kde; User's manual
The & kde; User's manual is an in-depth exploration of & kde;, including installation, configuration and customization, and use.
Application manuals
Native & kde; application documentation. All & kde; applications have documentation in & XML; format, which are converted to HTML when you view them. This section lists all the & kde; applications with a brief description and a link to the full application documentation.
The applications are displayed in a tree structure that echoes the default structure of the K menu, making it easy to find the application you are looking for.
Tutorials
Short, task based or informational tutorials.
& UNIX; manual pages
& UNIX; man pages are the traditional on-line documentation format for & UNIX; systems. Most programs on your system will have a man page. In addition, man pages exist for programming functions and file formats.
Browse info pages
TeXinfo documentation is used by many & GNU; applications, including gcc (the C/ C++ compiler), emacs, and many others.

The Man and Info sections
Man pages are the standard & UNIX; manual pages, and have been in use for many years on many operating systems. They are extremely thorough, and are the very best place to get information about most & UNIX; commands and applications. When people say RTFM, the Manual they are referring to is very often the man page.
The man pages are not perfect. They tend to be in depth, but also extremely technical, often written by developers, and for developers. In some cases this makes them somewhat unfriendly, if not downright impossible for many users to understand. They are, however, the best source of solid information on most command line applications, and very often the only source.
If you've ever wondered what the number is when people write things like man(1) it means which section of the manual the item is in. You will see & khelpcenter; uses the numbers to divide the very many man pages into their own sections, making it easier for you to find the information you're looking for, if you're just browsing.
Also available are the Info pages, intended to be a replacement for the man pages. The maintainer of some applications no longer update the man pages, so if there is both a man page and an info page available, the info page is probably the most recent. Most applications have one or the other though. If the application you are looking for help on is a & GNU; utility, you will most likely find it has an info page, not a man page.
Navigating inside the Info pages
Info documents are arranged hierarchically with each page called a node. All info documents have a Top node, & ie; the opening page. You can return to the Top of an info document by pressing Top.
Prev & Next are used to move to the previous/ next page at the current level of the hierarchy.
Clicking on a menu item within a document moves you to a lower level in the hierarchy. You may move up the hierarchy by pressing Up.
Man is treated similarly to info, with the section index being the Top node and each man page on the level below. Man entries are one page long.
The & kde; glossary
The glossary provides a quick reference point, where you can look up the definitions of words that may be unfamiliar to you. These range from & kde; specific applications and technologies, through to general & UNIX; computing terms.
In the left hand pane you will see a tree view, with two choices: Alphabetically or By topic. Both contain the same entries, sorted differently, to allow you to quickly find the item of interest.
Navigate down the tree views to the left, and items you select will be displayed on the right.
The menus and toolbar
& khelpcenter; has a very minimal interface, allowing you to concentrate on getting help rather than learning how to use the help browser.
The icons available to you in the toolbar are as follows:

A Desktop Environment
An Application Development Framework
An Office Application Suite
& kde; The Desktop Environment
& kde; The Application Development Framework
& kde; The Office Application Suite
& kde; is a desktop environment. In other words, & kde; is a collection of programs, technologies and documentation that attempt to make life easier for computer users. & kde; is targeted at & UNIX; workstations. It features network transparency and a contemporary work philosophy.
The creators of the K Desktop Environment are a world-wide group of software engineers. This group's major goal in free software development is to provide high quality software that empowers the user with easy control of his computer's resources.
& kde; seeks to fill the need for an easy to use desktop for & UNIX; workstations, similar to the desktop environments found under & MacOS; or & Windows;. & kde; meets the requirement of users for an easy to use work environment. Tools used to reach this end are: enhanced inter-application communication, component reuse, generalized drag and drop, uniform look and feel and many more. Thus, & kde; offers much more than the traditional & UNIX; window managers.
Stability, scaleability and openness are qualities which have made & UNIX; the undisputed choice for the information technology professional for many years. & kde; builds on top of this excellent base framework and brings new, much needed qualities: usability, user friendliness and beauty! & kde; was the first, and stays the forefront player in bringing these qualities to & UNIX;, which constituted for years, the premier platform for server computers and scientific institutions, but was n't very attractive for desktop users.
Without & UNIX; the Internet would not exist, or at least would have a vastly different form. & UNIX; has not, until now, addressed the needs of the average computer user. This fact is particularly unfortunate, since a number of implementations of & UNIX; (Linux;, FreeBSD, NetBSD, & etc;) are freely available on the Internet, all of which are of exceptional quality and stability.
In combination with a free implementation of & UNIX;, & kde; provides to the world an open and completely free desktop computing platform either at home or at work.
This platform is available to anyone free of charge including its source code for anyone to modify.
While there will always be room for improvement we believe we have now delivered a viable alternative to some of the more commonly found and commercial operating systems/ desktops combinations available today. It is our hope that the combination of & UNIX; and & kde; will finally bring the same open, reliable, stable, and monopoly free computing to the average computer user that scientists and computing professionals world-wide have enjoyed for years.
& kde; focuses on the user's needs, but it's obvious that this focus is more easily achieved by also giving developers the best tools. & kde; code contains, and comes with, some of the best development technologies of the modern computing age.
Authoring applications under & UNIX; /X11 used to be an extremely tedious and labor intensive process. & kde; recognizes the fact that a computing platform is only as good as the number of first class applications available to the users of that particular platform.
& kde; defines new technologies in & DCOP; and KParts, created to offer a component document model and technology. Together with the complete & kde; libraries programming interface, & DCOP; /KParts are set in direct competition with other similar technologies like & Microsoft; MFC / COM / ActiveX technologies. The excellent quality and the high level of refinement of & kde; 's application programming interface (API) enables developers to focus on original and interesting issues and avoid reinventing the wheel.
In its current form, & kde; provides, apart from the essential desktop component applications, a suite of powerful office programs known to the world by the name & koffice;.
& koffice; is based on the & kde; & DCOP; /KParts technologies. It currently contains: a word processor with desktop publishing capabilities (kword;), a spreadsheet application (kspread;) and accompanying charting program (kchart;), a presentation program (kpresenter;) and a vector drawing program (kontour;). Tying things together is the KOffice Workspace, an integrated shell to ease the use of the & koffice; components in conjunction with each other. Additional components include an email client, a news reader, and a powerful PIM (Personal Information Manager - an organizer).
While some of those components are still in alpha development, others are already extremely powerful. For example, & kpresenter;, & kde; 's presentation application, was successfully used at the 5th International & Linux; Congress in Cologne, Germany to deliver a & kde; presentation.
We would like to invite you to learn more about & kde; and koffice;.

Introduction
This document is a brief introduction to the K Desktop Environment. It will familiarize you with some of the basic features of & kde;.
This guide is far from covering all aspects of the K Desktop or even most of them. It will only describe some of the most basic ways to accomplish a few of the most common tasks.
We assume that you are already familiar with at least one graphical user interface, for example CDE;, Geos, GEM, & NeXTSTEP;, & Mac;, OS/ 2 or & Microsoft; & Windows;. So we will not explain the usage of the mouse or the keyboard but concentrate on hopefully more interesting things.
An Overview of & kde;
This section is for users who prefer to learn by exploring and want only a brief orientation to get started. Later sections provide a more thorough introduction to the environment, with helpful hints and shortcuts. If you are impatient to get started, skim this section, go play for a bit, then come back and peruse the other sections of this guide as needed.
& kde; provides a highly configurable desktop environment. This overview assumes that you are using the default environment.
The & kde; Desktop
A typical & kde; desktop consists of several parts:
A panel at the bottom of the screen, used to start applications and switch between desktops. Among other things, it contains the & kmenu;, a large & kicon; which displays a menu of applications to start when clicked.
A taskbar, by default embedded in the panel, used to switch between and manage currently running applications. Click on an application on the taskbar to switch to the application.
The desktop itself, on which frequently used files and folders may be placed. & kde; provides multiple desktops, each of which has its own windows. Click on the numbered buttons on the panel to switch between desktops.
Ready, Set, Go!
Here are a few quick tips to get you up and running.
To start an application, click on the & kicon; button on the panel (called the kmenu;) and choose an item from the menu.
Click the icon that looks like a picture of a house on the panel to access the files in your home folder using & konqueror;, & kde; 's File Manager utility.
Choose K menu System Konsole to get a & UNIX; command prompt, or press Alt; F2 to get a mini command prompt window to execute a single command.
Choose the Control Center item on the & kmenu; to configure & kde;.
Press Alt; Tab to switch between applications and Ctrl; Tab to switch between desktops using the keyboard.
Use the & RMB; mouse button to access context menus for the panel, desktop, and most & kde; applications.
Launching Applications
Using the & kmenu; and the Panel
At the bottom of the screen you will find the desktop panel, which is called & kicker;. You use the panel to launch applications. Have a look at the button on the left with a large & kicon;.
This button is called the & kmenu;. It has a small arrow on the top to indicate that it will pop up a menu if you click on it. Just do it! The pop-up offers you easy access to all & kde; applications installed on your computer system.
Customizing & kicker;
If you use one application or tool very often, then you may want to have even faster access to it, of course. In this case, you can add a single application, or an entire sub-menu of the & kmenu;, as a special quick-launch button, on to the panel. If you want to reach the & kfind; application directly via a launch button, simply choose K menu Panel Menu Add Button Find Files (By this we mean that you should first click the & kmenu;, then select Panel Menu, where the small arrow to the right indicates that another menu will pop up. In this menu, choose Add, then Button, and in the next sub-menu, Find Files).
You can add an entire menu this way, or one of the & kicon; button sub-menus. For example, if you have & koffice; installed and want quick access to all the & koffice; applications, without having to navigate through the & kmenu;, then instead of choosing an application, click on the Add this menu menu entry. Now you will have instant access to all the & koffice; applications, without having to put an icon for each on the panel.
You can move all items of the panel around with the Move command of the context menu. Just click with the third mouse button (the third mouse button is normally the right button, but if you have configured your mouse differently, for example for left-handers, it might also be the left one). A menu will pop up where you can choose Move. Now move the mouse and see how the icon follows while still staying on the panel. When you are done, simply hit the first mouse button (by default the left one). As you may have noticed, there is also a menu entry Remove in case you are tired of a certain launch button on your desktop.
Using Context menus
This leads us to another interesting topic: in many places, you can click the right mouse button to display a context menu with choices that are applicable to the item you clicked. It is therefore always a good idea to try out the third mouse button on something, if you do not know what to do with it. Even the background of the desktops has such a menu!
Other Panel features
There are other interesting things possible with the panel. One may be important if you have a low resolution on your monitor: it is the hide-and-show function, activated by clicking on the small arrowed button, which is at one or both ends of the panel.
Perhaps you just do n't like the panel extending the full width of the screen. That's easily changed! & RMB; on an empty space in the panel, and choose Configure Panel.... In the & kcontrol; dialog that pops up, you can choose Length on the Appearance tab, and use the slider there to set the panel to less than 100% width.
If you're following along, and have that dialog open anyway, then feel free to play with all the options, and use the Apply to see the effect they have. You can easily reset everything to the default configuration, by simply pressing the Use Defaults button.
By the way, if you are not sure what a certain button does in & kde;, just move the mouse pointer over it and wait for a short while: & kde; has a built-in mini context help, called tool tips, which explains the functionality of such controls in a few words.
But I want my command line back!
Just calm down, there is nothing to fear. & kde; does not want to take your beloved (and sometimes very effective) command line away from you. You can move your files with the desktop, but you can also use the & UNIX; commands you are accustomed to. In fact, kde; puts command line power at your fingertips, in perhaps some surprising places.
& kde; provides a very sophisticated command line window called & konsole;. Choose K menu System Konsole to start it. This may be something you want on your panel: luckily it's already there in the default configuration!
Sometimes, you only want to enter one command on the command line. In these cases, you do not need a full-blown terminal. Just hit Alt; F2 and you get a small command line where you can enter one command. The command line window will disappear afterwards, but it remembers your command.
When you pop up this window (which we call minicli by the way) and hit the Up arrow, you can browse through all the commands you have previously entered. Also, you can enter & URL; s in minicli to open a & konqueror; window with the specified & URL;.
& konqueror; and the editor & kate; can both display terminal windows, which behave just like & konsole;. In & konqueror;, you can turn this on with the menu choice Window Show Terminal Emulator. The embedded terminal will display at the bottom of your & konqueror; window, and the really clever thing is that it will follow your clicks in the file manager view, changing folder as you do. In & kate; you can display a terminal with the menu choice Settings Show Console.
To display a & UNIX; man page, enter man: command in minicli, where command is the name of a & UNIX; command.
To search for a word or words on the Google search engine, you can try entering gg: word or words. There are a whole lot more of these shortcut commands, and you can even add your own! Take a look in & kcontrol;, in the tab Web Browsing Enhanced Browsing.
Finally, there's a way to have your command line always available, no matter what you're doing - add one to your & kicker; panel!
Simply & RMB; click on an empty space in the panel, and choose Panel Add Applet Application Launcher. This will embed a mini-cli directly into your panel, complete with command history.
So, in conclusion, the command line is never far from view when you're using & kde;.
Working with windows
If you have not already done so, start an application using the kmenu;; say, Find Files.
A window! What now?
Well, usually people work inside windows, but sometimes you may want to manipulate windows. Here's a quick overview of some of the most common window related functions:
Move a window
Drag the window's title bar, or hold the & Alt; key down and drag anywhere in the window.
Resize a window:
Drag the window's border, or hold the & Alt; key down and drag with the & RMB; anywhere in the window.
Maximize a window
Click the maximize button in the titlebar (in the default decoration it is the square, next to the X) to make the window fill the screen, or if the window is already maximized, to shrink it back to its original size. Clicking with the & MMB; maximizes the window vertically, and with the & RMB;, horizontally.
Iconify a window
Click the iconify button in the titlebar (next to Maximize) to hide the window. Restore it by clicking on the window's icon in the taskbar.
Switch between windows
Aside from the usual mouse click to switch to another window, you can use Alt; Tab to switch windows. See below for more techniques.
Title bar buttons
& kde; windows have some pretty standard buttons on their title bars which give you fast access to some common operations. The default button layout looks like this:
On the left side:
A menu button. This usually shows a mini icon for the application. Click on it to get a window operations menu. Shortcut: Alt; F3 opens the window menu.
Optionally a sticky button. What the heck is this? Stay tuned!
On the right side:
An iconify button.
A maximize button.
A close button. This closes the window. Shortcut: Alt; F4.
Switching between windows
Now that we know how to deal with windows, we encourage you to open some other windows using the panel, since we will now discuss how to switch between different windows. Since this is such a common activity, & kde; offers several ways to do it; pick your favorite!
Many window systems require you to click the mouse in another window to begin using it. This is & kde; 's default behavior, termed Click To Focus focus policy. But you can also configure your desktop in a way that moving the mouse pointer on to a window will activate it. This is called Focus Follows Mouse. If you select this policy using the kde; Control Center, the window under the mouse pointer is always the active one. It does n't necessarily come to the front automatically, but you can still click on to the titlebar or the border of a window or, a & kde; special, you can use the & Alt; key and click the & MMB; anywhere on the window to raise it.
Here are some other methods to switch windows:
Pick a window from the window list menu. To open the menu, click the & MMB; on an empty area of the desktop, or click the icon with several windows on the panel, or finally click the up arrow at the left hand end of the taskbar in the panel.
Hold down the & Alt; key and press Tab to cycle through the windows.
Use the taskbar (see below).
Using the Taskbar
The taskbar displays a list of small icons, one for each window on the desktop. In the default & kde; setup the taskbar is located inside the panel, but it can also be located at the top or the bottom of the screen.
A simple & LMB; click on the taskbar button will pop up a list of the open windows for that application and you can choose the window you want to use. Choosing one of these entries with the left will bring you to the selected window immediately. Click on a taskbar entry with the right and you will see a menu allowing you to operate on all the windows grouped under that icon, or each window individually.
You can choose to see all the windows on all the desktops in your taskbar, no matter which desktop you are currently viewing, or to only see the icons for the desktop you are looking at. You can also choose to ungroup the icons, so that each open window will have its own icon in the taskbar. These and many more options are available simply by right clicking on the taskbar handle (the small textured bar at the left hand side) and choosing Configure Taskbar....
The icons on the taskbar resize themselves to make room for applications, so you can fit many more applications than you might think. Making the panel wider will let the taskbar icons take on a row and column layout, but they will still resize to fit more icons.
Using Virtual Desktops
Now, what was that sticky thing?
It may happen that you have more windows open than space on your desktop. In this case you have three possibilities:
Leave all windows open (cluttered desktop)
Iconify those windows which you do not need at present and use the taskbar or Alt; Tab to switch between them (still a bit confusing and much work!)
Recommended: Do what a real operating system does if there is not enough physical memory: Use virtual memory, in this case virtual desktops.
The third option is the way to go! & kde; can handle several different desktops, each with its own windows. The default configuration provides four desktops. You can switch between the virtual desktops easily with a click on one of the desktop buttons on the panel. Also Ctrl; F1... F4 will send you to the corresponding desktop immediately, or Ctrl; Tab will cycle through the desktops.
Virtual desktops are very nice. But sometimes you want a window to be present on every desktop. This could be, for example, a small chat window, an alarm clock or whatever. In this case you can use the above mentioned sticky button which will pin the window on the background so that it will appear on every virtual desktop.
The sticky button can also be used to move a window from one virtual desktop to another one: push the sticky pin on the window, switch to a different desktop, and release the pin by pushing it again. You can achieve the same result by using the context popup menu of the window's entry in the taskbar (menu item To Current Desktop) or the To Desktop option on the window operations menu.
Managing your files
A common metaphor of graphical desktops is the use of folders to represent folders on your hard disk. Folders contain files and other folders. A & kde; application called & konqueror;, the K File Manager, uses this metaphor to help you manage your files.
Using & konqueror;
The first time you start & kde;, a window with lots of icons in it appears. This is a & konqueror; window displaying the files in your home folder (the area where your personal files are stored). The pathname of the folder is displayed under the window's tool bar. If you do n't see such a window now, click the icon on the panel that looks like a folder with a picture of a house.
To open a file or folder, simply click it once with the & LMB;. You can also choose Window Show Navigation Panel from the menu to display the folder hierarchy for more direct navigation. Or you can edit the path displayed under the toolbar to get to a specific folder quickly.
Opening Files
& kde; comes with a set of applications to view and edit files of many common types, and when you click a file containing, say, a document or image, & konqueror; will start the appropriate application to display the file. If it does n't know what application to start to open a file you clicked, & konqueror; will prompt you for the name of the application to run, and when you have chosen, & konqueror; will offer to remember your choice for the next time you open a file of that type.
& konqueror; uses & MIME; types to associate files with applications.
Dragging and Dropping Icons
To copy or move a file, simply drag its icon to the desktop, to another & konqueror; window, or to a folder icon. When you release the button, & konqueror; displays a menu to allow you to choose to copy, move, or create a link to the file.
Note that if you choose to create a link, & kde; creates a & UNIX; symbolic link (not a hard link), so if you move or delete the original file, the link will be broken.
Most & kde; applications also support drag and drop operations: you can drag an icon on to a window of a running application, or on to an icon of an application that is not started, to have the application open the file. Try it!
Setting File Properties
To change file properties, such as its name and permissions, & RMB; click the icon and choose Properties from the menu.
Working with Archives and Networks
In the recent past, you needed special software to access files on the Internet. Not any more!
& kde; supports a technology called Network Transparent Access (NTA) which allows you to work with files on the other side of the world as easily as those on your local hard disk.
For example, to access files on an & FTP; server, just choose Location Open Location from a & konqueror; menu, and enter the & URL; of an & FTP; server. You can drag and drop files to and from the folders on the server just as if they were on your local disk. You'll even be able to open files on the & FTP; server without having to manually copy them to your local disk (kde; does it for you when necessary).
Note that & konqueror; uses anonymous & FTP; access, which may restrict your access to files on the & FTP; server. If you have an account on the server, you can supply your user ID as part of the & URL;, like this: ftp: / / userid @ server / folder
& konqueror; will prompt you for your password, and if the login succeeds, you will have full access to your files on the server.
If you are used to the WinZip utility on & Microsoft; & Windows;, then you will be happy to hear that & kde; can look into tar archives, too. It treats such archives just like a normal folder, and you can browse into the archive, open files, & etc; In general, accessing files on the Internet and in archives should look and feel just like accessing files on your local disk, except for delays imposed by the network and extracting the archive.
Using Templates to access Applications and Devices
In & kde; it's easy to put icons on the panel or the desktop to access your applications. It's just as easy to add icons to access other items of interest. & kde; has templates for shortcuts to:
Applications
Printers
Mountable Devices (eg; floppy drives)
Internet resources (eg; WWW documents, & FTP; folders)
Documents for some of & kde; 's & koffice; applications.
You can add any of these items to the desktop by & RMB; clicking where you want the icon, and choosing Create New and selecting the item you want to link to.
Nearly every item in the & kmenu;, on the desktop, and on the panel refers to a. desktop file on disk. The. desktop file specifies what icon to display, as well as specific information about what the icon represents (an application, device, or & URL;). You can drag any. desktop file to the panel to create a quick-launch button.
Mounting devices
& UNIX; provides access to storage devices other than the primary hard disk through a process called mounting. & kde; uses. desktop files to allow you to easily mount, unmount, and access files on secondary storage devices such as floppy drives and & cdrom; drives.
As an example, here are the steps needed to create an icon to access files on a floppy disk:
Many systems require you to be logged in as root to mount and unmount devices.
Right click on the desktop and choose Create New Device Floppy Device....
On the General tab of the resulting dialog, change the name to whatever you like, in the text box at the top.
On the Device tab, enter / dev/ fd0 (or the path to the floppy device as it is named on your system) as the Device.
You can add a Mount Point here too. This should be an existing folder, but empty. Common mount points are / mnt/ floppy or / floppy, but you can just as easily have floppy disks mounted on ~/ mydisk if you want.
Click the Unmounted Icon and select the picture of a floppy disk without the green light.
Once you're happy with your choices, choose OK and you are finished!
Now, place a properly formatted floppy in the drive and click the Floppy icon to have & kde; mount the floppy drive and display the files on the disk. Before removing the disk from the drive, & RMB; click the Floppy icon and choose Unmount from the menu.
Configuring your desktop
If you do not like something about the way the desktop looks or operates, you can probably change it. & kde; is very configurable and you can change almost every aspect of the appearance and the behavior of your desktop. Unlike many other & UNIX; desktop environments, you do not have to edit cryptic configuration files either (but you can if you really want to!) You use the & kcontrol;, a special program for configuring your desktop.
Using the kde; Control Center
Launch the & kcontrolcenter; from the kmenu;. A window with two panes appears, displaying a list of modules in the left pane.
Open a module by clicking its name; a list of submodules will appear. Then, click one of the submodule category names to edit its configuration in the right pane.
Changing the configuration is fairly straightforward. A help button is available on each configuration panel to explain settings that are not obvious. Each panel has buttons labeled Help, Use Defaults, Apply, and Reset, which work as follows:
Help
Displays a short help text in the left hand pane, including a link to a longer manual for the module in question.
Use Defaults
Sets all the options in the current module back to the default at the time & kde; was installed.
Apply
Applies the current settings in the currently open module.
Reset
Resets the options to the state they were in when you opened the module. If you have already used the Apply button, then this button will reset the options to the state they were in when you pressed Apply.
If you make changes on one configuration panel and move to a different module without clicking OK or Apply first, & kcontrolcenter; will prompt you to ask whether your changes should be applied first.
Logging out
We sincerely hope that using & kde; gives you so much fun and pleasure that you never want to log out. But if you do, simply choose K menu Logout.
There is also a logout button directly on the panel, which looks like a small power button. Or you can press Ctrl; & Alt; Delete to log out.
Session Management
When you log out, & kde; can remember which applications you had open, as well as where all the windows were located, so that it can open them for you the next time you log in. This feature is termed Session Management. & kde; -aware applications will restore themselves to the state they were in when you logged out. For example, & kate; remembers which files you were editing.
Non-kde; applications do not memorize their state on logout, and & kde; will warn you to make sure that you have saved any important data in them when you start to log out.
To illustrate session management, choose K menu Editors Kate to start & kate;. Open a text document to edit. Now log out and back in. You will observe that & kate; will be restored to the exact same position on the screen, including the right virtual desktop, and the document we left open in & kate; before we logged out is opened again automatically. & kate; will even remember whether you had unsaved changes to your document before you logged out and will save them to the file you were working on if you choose Save from the File menu.
& kde;, an exciting Journey
We hope you enjoyed this brief tour of the K Desktop environment and that this unique desktop environment will help you get your work done faster and more comfortably than ever.
Please remember that the & kde; project is not a commercial venture, but rather a project run by volunteers from all over the world. We would like to invite you to join the & kde; project and become part of this unique network of people. If you are a programmer you might consider helping us write & kde; applications. If you are an artist or have experience with graphic design, consider creating icons sets, color schemes, sound schemes and logos for & kde;. If you enjoy writing we would love for you to join our documentation project.
As you can see there are many ways in which you can help. You are cordially invited to join this world-wide network of people dedicated to making & kde; the best desktop environment for any computer. Please visit www. kde. org for more information.
Welcome aboard on this exciting journey,
Your & kde; Team

Guide
& kde; Visual Dictionary of terms
This project was started to help unify the vocabulary used in & kde; documentation.
We provide this for you here as an aid to learning your way around the & kde; Graphical User Interface. These names have been standardized within & kde; documentation, so that you will always find interface items referred to in the same way.
The term Widget refers to the basic building block of a computer program's interface.
Each widget operates in a similar manner each time it is used, but the effect that the widget has depends on its place within the program.
Listing of Common & kde; Widgets
Currently, this guide consists of a table of the names of the graphical elements often found in & kde; documentation, and an example of each one.
Our hope, eventually, is to make this a much more complete document, which will take you on a visual tour of & kde;.

Glossary
Terminal emulator
Terminal emulator is simply a windowed shell; this is known as command line window in some other environments. If you want to use the shell, you should know at least a few of the system-level commands for your operating system.
Applet
A small application that occupies very little memory and screen space, and at the same time gives you some useful information or provides a control shortcut. For instance the Clock applet shows current time and date (and even a month diary if you click it), and System Monitor applet shows how busy your machine currently is in real-time.
Legacy Application
An X-window application which was not written with & kde; in mind. Such applications run fine in & kde;. However, they are not warned automatically when you shut down your & kde; session. You therefore must not forget to save documents open in these applications before you log out from & kde;.
Additionally, many of these applications do not support copying and pasting from & kde; compliant applications. & Netscape; 4. x browser is a prominent example of such application Some GNOME applications may provide limited interoperability with the & kde;..
Console Application
Application originally written for non-graphic, text oriented environment. Such applications run fine in & kde;. They must run within console emulator, like & konsole;. They are not warned automatically when you shut down your & kde; session. You therefore must not forget to save documents open in these applications before you log out from the & kde;.
Console applications support copying and pasting from & kde; -compliant applications. Simply mark the text in the console application with your mouse, switch to the & kde; -compliant application and press Ctrl; V to paste the text. If you want to copy from & kde; application to a console application, first mark the text with your mouse, press Ctrl; C, switch to the console application and press the middle button on your mouse If your mouse does not have a middle button, you must press left and right button at the same time. This is called middle button emulation and it must be supported by your operating system to work..

If you would like to add sounds in your own language, it is very easy to do so. Record the alphabet sounds and place them in a folder named'alpha '. Please write the letters (one per line) in a text file and save it with utf8 encoding in the'alpha' folder. Then record the most current syllables and put them in a folder named'syllab '. Write the syllables (one per line) in a text file and save it with utf8 encoding in the'syllab' folder. The sounds should be in wav or ogg format and long enough for KAudioPlayer to play them (between 1.5 and 2 seconds long, please add some silence if they are too short). Then make a tarball of all that and send it to me. Additionally you can tell me about special letters in your language so I can easily generate the special Characters toolbar.

Installation
For a start you could open an example file by using the File Open Example... menu. There are 2 files which you may use in order to get to know all the functions of & parley;. The file sample-en. kvtml & eg; shows you some vocabulary words in English, German and French.
A green check mark in the second column means that this entry is active. A red and white "X" indicates a deactivated entry that will not be practiced. See Editing Entries for more information on active entries.
Of course it is also possible to use the vocabulary list as an ordinary dictionary and to look up manually.
pronunciation. You can use IPA characters from the phonetic alphabet. See more about this in the according options dialog page.
an additional comment.
Using the keyboard
Tab
The cursor is moved to the smart search input field. If you start typing an expression in this field, & parley; will search the next best match after each key. The cursor in the vocabulary is then moved to this location.
If you press Return it will move to the next match.
If you only want entries that match from the beginning of the expression you must press Ctrl; Return.
Pressing Shift; Tab or Tab will move back to the vocabulary.
The cursor moves inside the vocabulary table one column or line accordingly. If it reaches the edge of the vocabulary table, it will not move.
Page Up, Page Down
The cursor in the vocabulary is moved up or down one page (the amount of visible lines -1). If it has to jump beyond the edge of the vocabulary table, it will not move.
& Ctrl; Return
Invokes the Edit Properties dialogue for this entry.
Ins
Appends a new row at the end of the vocabulary. The cursor jumps into the Original row. You may type your entry right away or invoke the Edit Properties dialogue for modification of this entry.
If you have selected smart appending you will be prompted to enter expressions in the original language and their translations until you stop by pressing the ESC key.
Del
After confirmation in a safety dialogue, the current row or selection is removed from the vocabulary.
Ctrl; + or Ctrl; -
By pressing & Ctrl; and + or -, you can choose the previous or next item in the combo box determining the current lesson.
Using the mouse
Double clicking in a field in the table lets you edit this field.
Left mouse click on one of the header buttons will sort this column in ascending order. Another click will sort it in descending order. In case the column is displayed in alphabetical order, you can see a triangle at the end of the button showing the sorting direction.
Keeping the left mouse button pressed for about 1 second on one of the table header buttons will pop up its header menu.
Working on selections
If you mark several expressions, you can modify their properties together or save the selection as a new file.
The edit dialog has a different appearance for selections. Some properties are disabled as it does n't make sense to edit the expressions themselves or remarks of a whole range simultaneously.
All fields which may be modified are empty at the beginning to represent their unmodified state. Modifications of properties will only be saved if you confirm them by clicking on the Apply button.
Example
The direction of the learning can be switched randomly to avoid one way learning only.
All these settings can be summarized into profiles and retained under an arbitrary name.
Dialogs
Document Properties dialog
Open this dialog with Vocabulary Document Properties. This dialog also consists of several pages the determine properties that belong only to the current document. They are stored with the vocabulary.
General properties
General Document Properties screenshot
General Document Properties
Title
Here you enter the title of the document which is displayed in the window's title bar.
Authors
Usually you will enter your name in this field. If there are more than one author you might use a line for each person.
License
If you want to restrict (or better allow) the use of you vocabulary you should enter the according permission or license here.
I recommend something like the Free Document License
Remark
This field should contain things that do not fall in one of the other categories.
Lesson descriptions
Lesson descriptions dialog screenshot
Lesson descriptions
Here you add, modify or delete descriptions of your lessons.
The buttons should be pretty selfexplanatory except Clean Up. This one will remove all lesson descriptions that are unused in the current document.
Types descriptions
Similar to the previous section about lessons, you can edit your own expression types on this page.
Since the dialog page looks the same as the one before there is no picture.
Tenses
On the next page you may add the tenses you need.
Usage labels
The last page provides the possibility to enter your own usage labels.
If you think an important item is missing (from the above tense, type or usage label section) you should tell me, so I can include them in the application as standard item.
This way all the other users can benefit.
Document Options
Document Options dialog screenshot
Allow sorting
If you have created your vocabulary with a certain order, you can use this check box to turn sorting off for this document. A click in the header button will then no longer sort the row.
Version 0.7 of & parley; additionally offered the choice to either use 8Bit or Unicode to store the vocabulary files. This is no more supported. The files are always stored in Unicode to prevent wrong rendering of characters.
Unfortunately there is no backwards compatibility to versions below 0.6 any more but I think the benefit is worth it.
Language Properties dialog
Open this dialog with Vocabulary Language Properties.
Language Properties dialog screenshot
Language Elements
The following pages of this dialog determine for each language of this dictionary several elements that are used in the according queries.
Articles
For every gender you enter here the definite and the indefinite article. If there is none for this language, you leave the field empty.
Conjugation
In the similar manner you input the descriptor for the first, second and third person each in plural and singular.
Because many languages do not distinguish in the third person plural, there is a check box to determine this.
Leave the unneccessary fields empty.
Settings dialog
Open this dialog with Settings Configure & parley;.... The settings in this dialog are global and affect all vocabularies equally.
General
General settings dialog screenshot
General Settings Dialog
Save vocabularies automatically on close and quit
If you check this option, & parley; will automatically save the document if it was modified when you use the close button or when you quit & parley;.
As a side effect it also does not ask for confirmation to save when quitting with modified data but saves the vocabulary without asking.
Create a backup every 15 minutes
& parley; will automatically save the document if it was modified after the period you enter here when the option is checked.
An interval of 0 also stops this behavior.
Smart appending
If this feature is activated, you will repeatedly be prompted with the entry dialog. After entering the first original you have to enter the corresponding translations. Afterwards you proceed with the next original and its translations until you stop by pressing the & Esc; key.
When you are in this mode and modify the lesson in the dialog it has the same meaning as selecting the lesson in the toolbar. This way it is preselected when the next entry dialog appears.
The required lessons will have to be created in advance in the document settings.
Apply changes without asking
When checked, all options are save upon termination of & parley;. Otherwise you have to select the appropriate menu item.
Column Resizing
When you resize your main window it is convenient, if the columns resize automatically, too.
This is possible in two manners:
Automatic
& parley; makes each columns the same width except the leftmost with the lesson names which has half the size of the others. The second column which contains the picture that describes the state of the row has a fixed width.
Percentage
The widths of the columns are altered with the same factor the main window grew or shrunk.
If the last button labeled Fixed is set, no resizing of the columns is done.
Languages
Language Settings dialog screenshot
Language Settings dialog
Language code
Each column can be assigned a language. This is internally done with the usual international language codes & eg; en, de, it. These codes are also stored with the document.
You should always use the correct codes to be able to share vocabularies with others. Merging vocabularies also relies on the correct language codes.
Alternative code
Sometimes it may be useful to have a second language code because some languages have the usual short code and one or two longer codes. For German for example it is common to use de but either deu or ger is also possible according to ISO639-2.
Here you can give the language code a descriptive name in your own language which is shown in the header buttons in the main view.
Picture
Additionally you can add a nice icon to your language which is shown in the table header button.
& kde; 2 stores those pixmaps under $KDEDIR / share/ locale/ l10n/ language -code.
Keybord Layout
To be written.
Delete
Clicking an this button deletes the currently selected language code in the list.
Add
After entering a new language code in the field to its left, you use this button to append it to your list. After that you need to fill in the fields for the long name and the picture for the header button.
Add Language Data From KDE Database
Clicking on this drop down box opens a list that contains all the countries that are known in your & kde; installation. Ordered by country you can add your desired language properties to your personal list.
Maybe you want to change the language name or the according picture but I strongly recommend you keep at least the 2-byte language code and its 3-byte alternative if you do not have a special reason. This is to achieve compatible document files that can be shared among all users.
Add Language Data From ISO639-1
Clicking on this drop down box opens a list that contains all the language codes that are covered by ISO639-1.
Basically the previous two drop down boxes provide the same data. The former contains the language codes known in & kde; sorted by country whereas the second contains all ISO639-1 codes sorted alphabetically.

How do I start a new game?
When you uncover a square, a number appears: it indicates how many mines surround this square. If there is no number the neighboring squares are automatically uncovered. When you find a square that you are sure contains a mine, it is very useful to put a flag on it (by right-clicking).
The left button will uncover a square. If there is a bomb below that square, the bomb will explode, and the game will be over.
If there is not a bomb under the square, a number will appear. That is the number of neighboring squares that contain bombs. Which ones? you ask: That's the point of the game.
For each square (excluding edge and corner squares), there are 8 neighboring squares.
If none of the neighboring squares has a bomb, then a blank will be shown under the square, and all neighboring squares will be automatically uncovered.
The right button will mark a square as containing a mine (by drawing a red flag on it) or, if the option is set, as being uncertain (by drawing a question mark on it). The uncertain tag can be useful when you are puzzled about the positions of mines.
The middle button will clear the surrounding squares if the right number of squares is already flagged. It is very useful since it is much quicker than uncovering all individual squares.
If your flags are not properly positioned, you will explode a bomb.
Pressing the yellow smiley will start a new game.
These are the default settings. The mouse buttons can be reprogrammed. For more information, see the section entitled Game Options.
The & kmines; Screen
The & kmines; Screen
The & kmines; Screen
The & kmines; screen consists of:
A Box showing you the number of mines still left to be marked. Every time you flag a bomb site, this number will decrease by one.
This box does not determine if you are right or wrong, but only how many mines you need to theoretically mark before you are done with this game.
In this example, there are 40 mines to be marked.
A Yellow Smiley Face. Clicking this will start a new game. If you lose the game, it will become a frown.
The box on the right shows how much time this round has taken. The shortest time for each level is listed as the high score.

Spell-checking client
You may choose to use Ispell or Aspell as the spell-checking backend for & sonnet;. Ispell is more widely available and may have better international support, but Aspell is gaining popularity as it claims to give better suggestions for word replacements.

It is recommend that you do not change the first two options unless you have read the International ISpell man page.

audiocd
Allows treating audio CD s like a real filesystem, where tracks are represented as files and, when copied from the folder, are digitally extracted from the CD. This ensures a perfect copy of the audio data.
& juk; should quite happily play the. wav file, but if it has trouble, you may consider using the paranoia_level option, explained below.
Options
device
niceLevel
paranoia_level
Set the amount of error detection and correction used when extracting data.
Level 0
No detection or correction. Only useful if you have a perfect CD drive (unlikely).
Level 1
Enable basic error checking and correction.
Level 2
Default. Specifies that only a perfect extraction will be accepted.
Specify which Internet CD Database entry to use. Audio CD s do n't have track names, but the Internet CD Database is a clever system which uses a special unique identifier generated from the number and length of tracks on each CD to cross-reference a track listing. Track listings are contributed by the Internet community and made available to all. Occasionally there will be multiple entries. You can specify which one to use.
You can submit your own track listings using & kscd;, the & kde; CD player.
Examples
audiocd: / ?device=/ dev/ scd0amp; paranoia_level=0amp; cddbChoice=0
Gives a listing of the tracks on the audio CD inserted in / dev/ scd0, which on & Linux; specifies the first SCSI & CD-ROM; device. If you copy tracks from the CD, digital extraction will be performed without error correction or detection. The CDDB Database entry 0 will be used.
Frequently Asked Question
I get The file or folder / does not exist. How do I fix that? I have an audio CD in my drive!
Try running cdparanoia -vsQ as yourself (not root). Do you see a track list? If not, make sure you have permission to access the CD device. If you're using SCSI emulation (possible if you have an IDE CD writer) then make sure you check that you have read and write permissions on the generic SCSI device, which is probably / dev/ sg0, / dev/ sg1, & etc;. If it still does n't work, try typing audiocd: / ?device=/ dev/ sg0 (or similar) to tell kio_audiocd which device your & CD-ROM; is.

Compilation and Installation
ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Configure & kmail;
& kmail; 's configuration window enables you to configure & kmail; in many ways. You can reach it via Settings Configure & kmail;....
Load Profile...
You can find a quick introduction to the Identities page in the Getting Started section.
The New Identity Dialog
General
The General tab allows you to specify some basic settings for the currently selected identity.
Your name
Organization
Email address
Advanced
Sent-mail folder
Drafts folder
Special transport
Signature
Accounts Page
You can find a quick introduction to the Accounts page in the Setting up your Account section.
Sending
Send messages in outbox folder lets you specify when queued messages, & ie; messages in the outbox folder pending to be sent, should be sent. You can choose between:
Queued messages will only be sent if you select File Send queued messages.
Queued messages will be sent after all checks for new mail, & ie; after automatic mail checks as well as after manual mail checks. Of course, you can also manually send the queued messages with File Send queued messages.
Default send method lets you define what happens when a message is sent. If Send now is selected, the message is sent to the mail server immediately, while if Send later is selected, the message is queued in the outbox to be sent later with the File Send Queued Messages command or automatically when you check your mail, depending on the setting of Send messages in outbox folder above.
Message property lets you select how your message will be encoded when it is sent. Allow 8-bit means that & kmail; will send your message in 8-bit ASCII, which means that all special characters such as accented letters will be sent as-is. If MIME Compliant (Quoted Printable) is selected, special characters will be encoded using standard & MIME; encodings, which may be more portable to mailing systems other than 8-bit ASCII. We recommend to use MIME Compliant.
Appearance Page
Fonts
This section allows you to change the type, size and character set of the display fonts. Message Body sets the font for the reader pane, Composer sets the font for writing messages in the composer window. There is a separate entry for Message List - Date Field so you can choose a monospaced font for the date field for better readability.
Colors
This section allows you to change the color of the text. Recycle colors on deep quoting means that even text that is quoted more than three times will appear in color. Note that the Quoted text colors only work in the message reader, not in the composer.
Layout
Headers
With Message header threading options you can select whether threads should appear expanded (open) by default or whether they should be collapsed (closed). You can of course still open/ close threads using the + / - buttons.
Composer Page
If checked, & kmail; will break long lines but will try to keep the correct quoting (eg; the gt; will always be at the start of the line).
Lets you turn word wrapping on and off in the composer window and lets you set the column at which words will be wrapped (you probably should not need to change the default value, which is 78).
If you do not like the Composer you can use a different editor. Note that the composer window will still open and the external editor will open as soon as you type just one character in the body of the message. If you are done, save the text and exit the editor. The text will now appear in the composer window, where you can send it. Note that your editor may not return immediately, you have to use & eg; gvim -f %f for gvim.
The Phrases tab lets you define the automatically generated lines that are added to message replies, forwarded messages, and the character that is added in front of quoted text. There are special & percnt; -denoted characters that will insert certain values, which are also displayed at the top of the Phrases section. You can add reply phrases in languages other than your default & kde; language using the Add... button. You can then choose between different languages with the Language drop down box. This will only work for languages whose i18n package you have installed.
Subject
This section contains a list of prefixes for Reply and Forward. If you receive messages that use prefixes different to the standard ones, you can add them here so & kmail; will recognize them. This way & kmail; can ignore them for sorting messages and when setting the subject of a reply or a forwarded messages, and optionally replace them with Re: or Fwd: respectively.
Charset
The Define custom mime header fields list sets the headers that & kmail; will use for its outgoing messages. You can both invent new fields and overwrite existing ones. This feature is only useful for advanced users.
Security Page
Reading
If checked, & kmail; will show & html; messages with their & html; formatting and layout. We strongly recommend to leave this option off, as security problems with & html; might show up. When this option is off, you can still read & html; messages, but only as plain text.
If checked, & kmail; can load external images, style sheets & etc; from the Internet when you look at an & html; message. We strongly recommend to leave this option off (although it has no effect if you only view plain text messages). By adding external references to their messages, people sending spam can detect that and when you have looked at their message. Note that this option has no effect on & Java;, JavaScript and Plugins - these are disabled anyway and cannot be enabled at all.
Ignore (recommended)
Ask
Only headers
Composing
Folders
Enable this option if you want to be asked for confirmation whenever you use Folder Move All Messages to Trash.
Jump to first unread message when entering a folder
Mark selected message as read after...
The trash folder is cleared of messages when you quit & kmail; if this option is selected.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ;)
Using PGP or GnuPG is very slow or it blocks & kmail;.
What should I know if I want to use PGP / GnuPG with & kmail;?
& kmail; provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for the basic functions of these programs; still you should understand how these programs work and what might make their use insecure. Some important issues:
You really should test if encryption works before you use it. & kmail; partly relies on PGP / GnuPG's error strings, which often change between different versions.
Trusting a foreign public key without checking it is not a good idea.
Why did & kmail; regenerate the index of a folder?
Can I use & kmail; together with a different email client, & eg; mutt?
Where can I get a list of changes between the versions of & kmail;?
The welcome screen lists all important changes for your version. It is displayed when you select Help kmail; Introduction.
Can I configure the location of my mail folder?
Exit & kmail;, make a backup of ~/. kde/ share/ config/ kmailrc, then open it with an editor and add & eg; folders=/ home/ username/. mail to the [General] section. Then move all your existing folders (including the hidden index files) to the new location. The next time you start & kmail; will use / home/ username/. mail instead of / home/ username/. kde/ share/ apps/ kmail. Note that & kmail; will lose its filters if you change the mail folder's location but forget to move your existing folders.
How can I use mail folders that are not in the normal & kmail; message folder location?
I'm one of those people whose mails consist of 100 quoted lines and one line written by myself. For some reason this annoys other people. Can & kmail; help me and make everyone's life better?
Sure. Just select a short relevant part of the original mail with the mouse before you reply. Only this part will then be quoted in your reply.
For some messages the value in the Date field is unknown or it is not correct.
My signature has two dashes above it. What's up?
Separating the signature from the message body with two dashes and a space on a single line is common usage. These symbols permit mail clients who recognize them to trim the signatures from a reply. If your signature does not already have this separator, & kmail; will automatically add it.
& kmail; fetches the same messages over and over again.
This happens if you have enabled Leave fetched messages on the server and your POP3 server does not support the UIDL command. There is currently no workaround besides disabling Leave fetched messages on the server. A more detailed explanation can be found in this mailing list post.
Are there any known bugs in & kmail;?
A list of submitted bugs is linked at the & kmail; homepage. Note that not all these bugs are valid. All in all we think that & kmail; is a very robust piece of software.
However, you should not run & kmail; while another email client is already accessing the files in ~/ Mail; if you try to do so, you might lose messages. Note that you should make backups of your messages anyway.
& kmail; does not display HTML mail properly.
References to external content like images, are disabled by default, as they can be used to track whether and when you read a message. Loading external references can be activated in the Security tab in & kmail; 's configuration dialog; also Plugins (like Macromedia Flash), & Java; and JavaScript will not be displayed in & kmail; for security reasons and there is no way to activate them.
Can I use two different versions of & kmail; at the same time? Can I go back from a current version of & kmail; to an older one?
You can only run one instance of & kmail; at once. We also recommend to stick to a certain version and not switch back and forth between different versions. Downgrading to an older version will probably cause problems, & eg; because the index file formats might have changed. Upgrading should never be a problem.
Does & kmail; support uuencoded files?
& kmail; crashed while I was writing a mail; is that mail is lost now?
& kmail; tries to save your mail to ~/ dead. letter in case of a crash. The next time you start & kmail; the mail composer should appear with your mail again; If it does not, try to open ~/ dead. letter with an editor. If it does not exist then the crash was so bad that & kmail; could not save your mail.
When I try to set a folder to be mailing list-aware, it does not do anything when receiving an email from the list.
Associating a folder with a mailing list has nothing to do with filtering the mailing list messages & mdash; you have to add a new filter rule manually; however, once you associated a folder with a mailing list you can use Message Reply to Mailing-List... or Message New Message to Mailing-List... and the mailing list address will be set in the To: field.
My SMTP server requires authentication; Does & kmail; support this?
There are two common techniques used for SMTP authentication: SMTP after POP3 and SMTP Auth. SMTP Auth can be set in the General tab of the SMTP configuration dialog. To use SMTP after POP3 you have to collect all your messages in the outbox and send them just after you have fetched new mail. You can make & kmail; send the queued messages automatically with the Send messages in outbox folder option on the Accounts configuration page.
Can I use & kmail; and procmail?
Yes, but it is important to do it the right way or you might lose mail. In order to use procmail and & kmail; you need to set up & kmail; so that it will fetch new mail from the spoolfiles in which procmail drops your mail. Do not set up procmail to deliver mail in a & kmail; folder, this cannot work.
For each procmail spoolfile you then need to create an account from which & kmail; will fetch new mail; you also need to make sure you specify the right lockfile name for this account. When setting up an account, & kmail; will do some minimal parsing on your. procmail file, and will try to list every spoolfile it has found, and also the lockfiles next to the procmail lockfile item. procmail lets the user specify lockfiles in three different ways, so there is no way to establish a correspondence between the spoolfiles and lockfiles; so it's really up to you to make sure you specify the right lockfile for each spoolfile.
Spellchecking does not recognize non-English characters.
Before you can use spellchecking the first time, you have to configure it. You can do so in the composer window's menu under Settings Spellchecker.... You can set the dictionary and the encoding there.
How do I use my Eudora / Netscape; / Outlook /... mail folders in & kmail;?
See the section Using other Mailbox files With & kmail;.
Can I use encryption with my normal (non- SSL) POP3 account?
If your POP3 server runs an ssh daemon, you can use ssh to tunnel your POP3 connection using the following command:
ssh -L 11000:127.0.0.1:110 user@host
Modify your & kmail; configuration to fetch the mail via POP3 from localhost and ssh will tunnel the connection for you.
If non-encrypted messages have already been sent via Internet, the only advantage of using ssh is that your password will be sent encrypted to the POP3 server.
Does & kmail; lock the folders it uses?
& kmail; does not lock the files in ~/ Mail.
To avoid the risk of losing mail if using a local account it is necessary to ensure that & kmail; uses the same type of locking as your mail delivery agent.
There are five different locking options you can use:
Procmail lockfile
Mutt dotlock
Mutt dotlock privileged
FCNTL (default)
none (use with care)
Procmail lockfile will use a small utility that comes with procmail called lockfile. You can use this if your mail folder is in a folder where you have write permission. This will not work on your / var/ spool/ mail/ user file in most cases. It will create. lock files on your account when & kmail; is checking for new mail. Please note that this will only work if procmail is installed on your system.
Mutt dotlock and Mutt dotlock privileged will both use a small utility that comes with mutt called mutt_dotlock. Mutt dotlock can be used in the same way as the Procmail lockfile option, with the same limitation with regards to the / var/ spool/ mail/ folders. However, the Mutt dotlock privileged option can create lock files in the / var/ spool/ mail folder. mutt_dotlock is a setgid program and this option will run it in setgid mode. Please note that these options will only work if mutt is installed on your system.
FCNTL will use the fcntl() system call.
If you do not want to use any locking, the none option is what you want. However, there are risks of losing mail when no locking is used.
How do I leave messages on the server?
See the Download filters chapter. If you want to leave all messages on the server: open up the Settings Configure & kmail;... window. Click on the Network page. Select your account from the account list and click the Modify... button. This dialog contains the Leave fetched messages on the server setting which you must enable.
How do I automatically insert a text footer within my messages?
The text footer is also called a signature (not to be confused with a cryptographic signature). Select Settings Configure & kmail;... Look in the Identity page for the Signature tab and add your signature there. Then go to the General tab on the Composer page and enable
How do I set up & Sendmail; to work with & kmail; if I have a dial-up connection?
First you should check if your distribution can do this for you. It probably has already been set up during installation.
If that is not the case, you may want to have a look at the Mail Queue HOWTO.
I've seen demonstrations of remote control behavior with & kmail;. Is there any documentation on the available interfaces?
You can get a list of functions by using this command in a shell: dcop kmail KMailIface. Some documentation is also available in kdenetwork/ kmail/ kmailIface. h and kdenetwork/ kmail/ mailcomposerIface. h.
ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Getting Started
This is a short introduction to & kmail; and its usage so you can start working with it right away. For more in-depth information see the Using & kmail; section. Note that & kmail; 's installation is described in the appendix.
Invoking & kmail; for the first time creates a folder called Mail in your home folder. This folder contains the initial folders (inbox, outbox, sent-mail, trash and drafts). Use Settings Configure & kmail;... to enter some initial information so & kmail; will be able to properly retrieve and send your messages.
The Configure window consists of six sections: Identities, Network, Appearance, Composer, Security, and Misc.
To begin sending and receiving messages you will only have to change some settings in the Identities and Network pages.
Setting your Identity
Setting up your Account
The Network page contains the settings that tell & kmail; how to send and receive your email messages. Many of these settings can vary greatly depending on the setup of your system and on the kind of network that your mail server is located in. If you do not know what setting to choose or what to put in a field, consult your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or system administrator.
Sending Messages
The Sending tab provides a list of ways to send messages. The first item in the list is the default way to send messages. Using the Add... button you can choose between two different ways of sending messages: SMTP and Sendmail. & Sendmail; here means a local software installation -- this has a reputation of being difficult to set up, so if you do not already have a working & Sendmail; configuration, choose SMTP and fill in the Name field with a descriptive name (eg; My Mail Account) and the Host field with the name and domain of your mail server (eg; smtp. provider. com). You will probably not need to change the Port setting (the default is 25).
If you do want to use & Sendmail; and you are using a dial-up connection, follow the instructions for setting up sendmail for a dial-up connection in the FAQ; section.
The way of sending messages configured here will be used for your default identity and for all other identities that have no own way of sending messages. You can use different ways of sending messages for different identities by selecting the Special transport checkbox in the Advanced tab of the Identities section.
Options relevant to Kolab server
Receiving Messages
To set up an account so you can receive mail, press the Add... button in the Receiving tab. You will then be prompted for the type of your email account. Most users should select POP3 or IMAP. If you want to use a local mailbox file, please see the FAQ about file locking.
You will then be presented with the Add account window. First, fill in the Name field to name your account. You can choose any name you like. Login, Password, and Host should be filled in with the appropriate information from your ISP or system administrator. You should not need to change the Port setting (the default for POP3 is 110, the default for IMAP is 143).
Options only relevant to DIMAP (Kolab server)
Options only relevant to IMAP
If you are using IMAP, you can optionally specify a path in the Prefix to folders field. This tells & kmail; where it can find your folders on the server. If you also have a shell account on the server and the messages are stored in your home folder it might be useful to store the messages in a subfolder Mail. Use this as a value in the Prefix to folders field so that & kmail; does not mix up mailbox files and other files. If you are not interested in this feature, simple leave the field blank.
If you check Automatically compact folders & kmail; removes the messages you deleted from the server as soon as you leave a folder. Otherwise the messages are only marked as deleted and it is up to you to compact the folders manually by using the menu item File Compact All Folders.
If you check Show hidden folders, folders whose name starts with a dot are also displayed.
Options only relevant to POP3
Select Leave fetched messages on the server if you want to leave your messages on the server after you downloaded them.
Select Exclude from & quot; Check Mailquot; if you do not want to check this account whenever you use File Check Mail. You can still check for new messages on this account with File Check Mail In.
Select Enable interval mail checking if you want & kmail; to check for new messages automatically. The interval can be specified below under Check interval.
inbox is the default folder for incoming messages. If you want to change that for some reason, you can do so with Destination folder. But what you probably want is a filter, which has nothing to do with this option.
With Precommand you can specify any program that & kmail; will execute just before fetching mail. Please specify the full path (do not use ~) and note that & kmail; will not continue until the program returns.
Options for both IMAP and POP3
If you select Store POP password in configuration file or Store IMAP password in configuration file & kmail; will remember your password so you will not have to type it every time you start & kmail; and fetch new mail.
Be warned that & kmail; cannot really encrypt your password, so people who can access your configuration files (eg; system administrators) can easily get your password if you select this option.
& kmail; supports encryption via SSL and TLS (TLS should be preferred if it is available).
Clear text,
PLAIN,
LOGIN,
DIGEST-MD5 (recommended) and
APOP authentication.
DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5 and APOP are secure on their own, the other options are only secure when used together with SSL or TLS. You should only use Clear text if your server does not support any of the other authentication methods. Additionally, for IMAP Anonymous is supported, but APOP is not. Use the Check what the server supports button on the Extras or Security tab to automatically select the most secure settings supported by your server.
You are now ready to send and receive mail. For IMAP, just open your folders in the folder tree in & kmail; 's main window. & kmail; then connects to your server and displays the messages it finds. For POP3 use File Check Mail.
Testing your Setup
First, you should send yourself a message to test your configuration. To send a message, either hit Ctrl; N, select the New Message icon or select the Message New Message... menu item. The composer window will appear. Fill in the To: field with your email address and type something in the Subject field. Send the message by selecting Message Send.
To check your email, select File Check Mail. In the lower right corner of the main window, a progress bar will indicate how many messages are being downloaded. If you receive the message you just sent, then congratulations! If, however, you receive any error messages while testing your setup, make sure that your network connection is working and recheck your settings at Settings Configure & kmail;....
ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Using other Mailbox Files with & kmail;
& kmail; offers an import tool for the messages and address books of some other email clients. You can access it using Tools Import.... Please make sure that you compact your folders in the other email client, no matter if you are going to use the import utility or if you are going to copy files manually. You only need to read this chapter if this tool does not work for you.
This section is for all of the users who need to move email messages from their previous email client over to & kmail;. & kmail; can store its messages using mbox or maildir formats, which are the most widely-used mailbox formats on & UNIX; systems. Mbox mailboxes store messages in one file, identifying where messages start and end with a From line (do not mix this up with the From: header that contains the message's sender); Maildir uses one file per message. For many & UNIX; email clients, all you must do is move your mailboxes to ~/ Mail (or make Mail a symbolic link to the folder containing your mailboxes), make sure they are writable by your user, and launch & kmail;. The mailboxes should now show up correctly in & kmail;.
Please have a look at the Tools section of & kmail; 's homepage first, to see if there is a tool that imports your mailbox and maybe even address book.
Do not use a second email client that accesses the files in ~/ Mail while & kmail; is running or you might lose messages. This section only explains how to import mailboxes to & kmail; once; it is not useful to you if you're planning to use several email clients for your mailboxes in the future.
Eudora Lite / Eudora Pro
Eudora uses the mbox format in its mail files. To use them with & kmail;, make sure that your Eudora mailboxes have been compacted, then copy the. mbx files (Windows; Eudora) or Eudora mailbox files (Mac; Eudora) to your ~/ Mail folder. You do not need to copy the index files. Once you start & kmail;, the mailboxes should appear in the Folders pane and the messages should be accessible in the Headers pane.
If messages do not appear in the Headers pane, your mailbox files may still contain & Windows; or & Mac; line-feed characters. Use your favorite text editor, the recode command or a scripting language to change the & Windows; or & Mac; line feeds to & UNIX; line feeds.
Mailsmith
MMDF
This format is close enough to the mailbox format that & kmail; should be able to use these mailboxes if you just copy them to your ~/ Mail folder; however, MMDF mailboxes have not been tested with & kmail;, so your results may vary. If you can get this format to work with & kmail;, please let us know so we can include more specific directions in the next documentation release.
MH mailboxes
MH mailboxes are directories containing files that correspond to each message in that mailbox. A shell script to convert MH mailboxes to mbox mailboxes, mh2kmail, is included at least in the source releases of & kmail;, but maybe not in the packaged releases. Running this script on a MH folder will convert it to an mbox file. We strongly suggest that you back up your MH mail folders before you use this script.
Forte Agent
In Agent:
Select the messages to export
Select FILE SAVE MESSAGES AS
Mark the UNIX FORMAT and SAVE RAW boxes
Give File a. txt extension and save.
In & kde;:
Move the previously-saved file to the correct ~/ Mail folder
Rename file without. txt extension
When you open & kmail; the new folder with appropriate messages will be there.
& Netscape; Mail
Pegasus Mail
Pegasus for win32 uses single files for Mail folders similar to & kmail;. Pegasus mail folder files have the extension. pmm but they are the same format as mbox except the messages do not start with the From header, but with a control character. To work around this, replace each instance of the control character with From aaa@aaa Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 1997. This From line should be the first line of every message, before the Received: and other headers. Make sure to use a text editor that lets you save the files in & UNIX; format or create new folders in Pegasus that are in & UNIX; format and copy your messages there.
Maildir / Outlook Express / xfmail
Tools to convert these formats are available at the Tools section of & kmail; 's homepage.
Lotus Notes, BeOS Mail files, cc: Mail, & etc;...
First you should have a look at Tools section of & kmail; 's homepage if there are tools to convert your messages.
Mail programs not listed here or on the homepage probably do not work with & kmail; as they use proprietary mail formats that & kmail; cannot understand. However, there is no harm in trying! If the mailbox file looks similar to the mbox format, try copying the mailbox file (remember, the index file is not needed) to your ~/ Mail folder and see what happens if you start & kmail;. If you get mailboxes from your favorite email client to work in & kmail;, please tell us how you did it so that we can include directions in a future revision of this documentation.
ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
Introduction
The & kmail; Team welcomes you to & kmail;, a user-friendly email client for the K Desktop Environment. Our goal is to make & kmail; a program that is beautiful and intuitive without sacrificing power.
If you have never set up an email client on a & UNIX; system before, we suggest that you read through the Getting Started section first so that your setup goes smoothly.
Since most people do not read documentation anyway, here is a collection of the most helpful tips:
Although & kmail; can be considered reliable you should keep backups of your messages, & ie; just copy the files and folders in ~/ Mail (including the hidden ones that start with a dot) to a safe place.
We hope you will enjoy & kmail;!

Using & kmail;
The Main Window
The main window is the window that appears when & kmail; is started. It is by default divided into three panes:
Folder list (on the left)
This pane contains the list of your message folders (other email programs may call them mailboxes). To select a folder, simply click on it. The messages contained in the folder will now appear in the Headers pane. The folder list can be displayed in both a short view, which takes up only a small portion of the left side of the screen, and a long view, which takes up the entire left side of the screen but is able to show more mailboxes. You can toggle between these two views under Appearance / Layout in the Settings Configure & kmail;... dialog. Also see the Folders Section for more information about how to use folders.
This pane lists header information (message Status Flags, Sender, Subject, Date, and other optional columns like Size, Attachment Flag, Important Flag, etc.) for the messages in the currently selected folder. Clicking on a header will select that message and display it in the Message pane; you can also select more than one message by holding down the & Ctrl; key when clicking on messages. You may sort the messages by clicking on the column that you wish to sort; if you click on the same column more than once, sort order will toggle between ascending/ descending and some alternative sorting criteria will become available (like sorting by Status when you click on the header of the Subject column). Clicking the right mousebutton on the list header shows a popup menu, which allows to show or hide several columns in the list.
Message preview pane (in the lower right by default)
This pane displays the currently selected message. Attachments appear at the bottom of the message, either as icons or embedded in the message, depending on View Attachments. For complex messages the structure of the message is shown in the message structure viewer below the preview pane. The placement of the preview pane as well as the placement of the structure viewer can be changed under Appearance / Layout in the Settings Configure & kmail;... dialog. Moreover, you can disable the preview pane and you can choose when the message structure viewer should be shown. You can scroll through the message page-by-page using the Page Up and Page down keys, or line-by-line using the up arrow and down arrow keys; you can also use key shortcuts to skip through your messages without having to use the mouse.

The Composer Window
The composer window is used to write new messages; it can be invoked via Message New Message... menu or from the New Message icon on the main window.
Composing a Message
To write your message, fill in the appropriate fields in the composer window. Use the View menu to select which header fields are displayed. The Identity field offers a Sticky option; if it is checked, the current identity will become the default identity when you open a new composer next time.
There are a variety of shortcuts to help you with writing your messages. The... buttons next to the To:, CC:, and BCC: fields will call up the address book so that you can select addresses from there.
When you start typing an address in the To: / CC: / BCC: fields, a popup will appear that offers matching addresses that have been used recently and matching addresses from your address book; if you do not like the automatic popup you can disable it by clicking with the & RMB; on the field and choosing a different completion mode.
Whenever you want to add more than one recipient in one of the fields, use a comma to separate each address from the next one. You may need to specify fully qualified addresses (ie; user@example. com) even for local users, depending on your system configuration.
Signing and Encrypting Messages
Creating HTML Messages
Adding Attachments
You can attach files to your message by using one of the methods below:
Click the Attach File (paper clip) icon and select the file you wish to attach;
Drag a file from the desktop or another folder into the composer window;
Select one of the options in the Attach menu.
Once a file is attached to your message, it appears in the attachments pane at the bottom of the composer window. You can use the & RMB; on each attachment to View, Save or Remove the attachment.
Use the Properties item to open the Message Part Properties dialog. The first field contains the attachment's & MIME; type. Just like the Name field, it should be automatically filled with an appropriate value. Sometimes the & MIME; type value may be wrong. You can then type in any & MIME; type or choose from the list of common & MIME; types. You can also select an encoding method for your file from the list of encoding options (normally, the default value works fine). Check the Suggest automatic display option if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this attachment. Whether this works or not depends on the recipient's email client and on his settings.
You can also attach public keys to the message by using the appropriate options in the Attach menu. PGP key attachments are handled like file attachments.
Checking the Spelling of your Message
To check the spelling of your message using a dialog, select Tools Spelling.... & kmail; uses sonnet; to check spelling, which is the & kde; frontend to the ispell or aspell spelling checker. Note that you may first need to configure the spellchecker using Settings Spellchecker....
Message Folders
Message Folders are used to organize your email messages. By default, if you have no existing message folders, messages are stored in the folder $KDEHOME / share/ apps/ kmail/. If you have existing message folders in ~/ Mail, these will be used instead. When you first start & kmail; the inbox, outbox, sent-mail, trash and drafts folders are created. These folders each have special functions:
inbox:
Where & kmail; by default puts your new messages when you ask it to check your mail.
outbox:
sent-mail:
By default copies of all messages that you have sent are put into this folder.
trash:
By default all messages that you have moved to trash are moved into this folder.
drafts:
Contains messages you started to edit but then saved to this folder instead of sending them.
You may find that the standard folders are fine for your needs; eventually, though, you will probably need folders to help you organize your messages. To create a new folder, select Folder New Folder...: the folder properties dialog will then prompt you for the necessary information. If you ever need to change the settings for a folder, select the folder you wish to modify in the Folders pane and select Folder Properties.
To move messages from one folder into another, select the message(s) you want to move and press the M key or select Message Move To. A list of folders will appear; select the folder from the list that you want to move the messages to. Messages can also be moved by dragging them from the Message list to a folder in the Folder list.
If you want to clear all of the messages out of a folder choose Folder Move All Messages to Trash. You can use Folder Delete Folder to remove a folder and all its messages and subfolders.

The Folder Icons section lets you choose icons that are different from the default ones in the folder list.

Message Filters
After using & kmail; for a while, you may find that you have trouble sorting out the new messages in your inbox when they arrive. Filters allow you to automatically perform certain actions on incoming messages and to manually perform actions on selected messages in a folder.
Filters consist of: filter criteria, whose rules are used as criteria to determine whether this filter should be applied to a given message; and a list of filter actions, which describe what is to be done with, or to, the message if the search pattern matches. Read more about filter criteria and filter actions in the following subsections.
Filters are considered one after the other, starting with the first filter in the list. The first one whose pattern matches the given message gets executed; you can request that the remaining filters also be applied, but the default is to stop processing at the first matching filter.
Usually, filters are used on incoming messages, but they can also be applied to sent messages or to an arbitrary message or group of messages. To selectively filter messages, select the messages you want to filter in the message list and either type Ctrl; J or select Message Apply Filters: this will apply all filters that have been marked for manual filtering in the filter dialog to those messages.
Fast Filter Creation
There are two methods for creating a filter; the quick method is to use Message Create Filter: this will call the filter dialog and present you with a new filter which has the first rule of the search pattern and the first action (as Move into Folder) preset. In most cases, all you have to do is select the folder where the message should be moved to; but you can, of course, edit the filter as you like.
When creating a filter on mailing list messages this method will try really hard to find a criterion that uniquely identifies messages from that list; If it succeeds, the guessed name of the list is presented in the Message Create Filter Filter on Mailing-List... menu entry.
The second method is to manually construct a filter from scratch by calling the filter dialog through Settings Configure Filters.... The filter dialog is described in detail in the following subsection.
The Filter Dialog
This dialog allows you to manage and edit your list of filters.
You can reach it either via Message Create Filter or Settings Configure Filters....
The dialog is divided into four main sections:
Available Filters
This group contains the list of filters and some action buttons to modify the filters, namely: to create new filters; to move them up or down the list; to delete them; or to rename them. If you select a filter from the list, its properties are shown in the right-hand half of the dialog.
Filter Criteria
In this group you can edit the pattern that messages must match for the filter to be applied to them. You can select here whether all of the defined rules must match or whether it suffices that any one of them matches. See Search Patterns below for a detailed description of each search rule type.
You can click on More to get an additional (initially empty) rule if you want to define more-complex patterns and on Fewer to remove the last rule. Clear clears the pattern, & ie; it removes all but two rules from screen and resets those two.
Filter Actions
In this group you can edit the list of actions that are applied to all messages that match the defined filter criteria. See Filter Actions below for a detailed description of each action type.
You can click on More to get a new, empty action (if you want to define more than one action) and on Fewer to remove the last action. Clear clears the list, & ie; it removes all but one action and resets that one.
Advanced Options
In this group you can define a few advanced options for filters that allow you to refine your filtering.
Using the first row of check boxes, you can toggle when the filter is applied: the to incoming messages option means that the filter is applied to messages when you receive them (ie; on Check Mail); the to sent messages options means that the filter is applied to messages when you send them and the on manual filtering option controls whether to apply this filter when filtering is specifically selected (ie; via Message Apply Filters.)
Filters are automatically named unless you explicitly rename them using the Rename... button. The dialog assumes that it should continue auto-naming the filter as long as the filter name starts with lt;.
If you apply filter changes, via OK or Apply, only valid filters are actually copied to the internal filter manager.
Similarly, empty rules and actions are removed from the pattern and action list respectively, before the filter is saved.
Search Patterns
The most common use of filters is to filter on the sender of messages; this can be done by choosing From. A good bet for a mailing list would be lt; recipientsgt;, but there are other criteria a filter can search for (note that all patterns are interpreted case-insensitively):
& lt; messagegt;
Searches the whole message (ie; headers, body and attachments, if any);
& lt; bodygt;
Searches the body of the message (ie; the whole message except the headers);
& lt; any headergt;
Searches the headers of the message;
& lt; recipientsgt;
Searches the To and CC header fields of the message;
& lt; size in bytesgt;
Sets upper or lower bounds on the message size;
& lt; age in daysgt;
Sets upper or lower bounds on the message age;
& lt; statusgt;
Sets restrictions on the status of the message;
Any other name
Searches the header field that is given by that name.
Available for
Filter Action
The most common use of filters is to sort incoming messages to certain folders; this can be done by choosing Move into Folder. Here is a list of all possible actions:
Move into Folder
This will file the message into another folder, removing it from its current folder if necessary; you cannot, currently use & imap; folders as a target.
Copy to Folder
This will copy the message to another folder.
Set Identity To
This will set the identity that will be used if you reply to this message.
Mark As
This allows you to mark the message as read or important (flagged), but also as forwarded, replied, & etc;
Set Transport To
This will set the method of transport (eg; SMTP) that will be used if you reply to the message.
Set Reply-To To
This will modify the Reply-To field of this message. This can be useful for mailing lists that automatically set a Reply-To which you do not like.
Forward To
Redirect To
This will redirect the message as-is to another email address.
Confirm Delivery
Will try to return a message to the sender that indicates successful delivery of their message, if the sender requested that.
This action allows you to select who will get delivery receipts from you. Though you can globally enable the sending of delivery confirmations in the Configure & kmail;... dialog (Security page) we recommended not to send them to everyone, since this makes tracking of spam messages, for example, very easy for the sender.
Execute Command
This will execute a program, but will not modify the message. Specify the full path to the program you want to execute; & kmail; will then block until the program returns. If you do not want & kmail; to block then append'amp; 'to the command. You can feed the program with the parts of the mail: percnt; 0, percnt; 1, & etc; stand for files representing the message parts; for common messages percnt; 0 is the text, percnt; 1 the first attachment and so on. Additionally, the whole message is fed into the program's stdin; and every occurrence of percnt; {foo} is replaced by the content of the foo header.
This currently only works if the message has at least one attachment. No, not even percnt; 0 will work in the general case!
You can enter arbitrarily-complex shell commands here, since & kmail; uses a sub shell to execute the command line; therefore, even this command will work (within its limits): uudecode -o $(mktemp kmail-uudecoded. XXXXXX) & amp; echo $'\\a '
Pipe Through
This will feed the message to a program: if the program returns output, the entire message (including the headers) will be replaced with this output; if the program does not return output or exits with a return code other than 0 (indicating an error occurred), the message will not change. Specify the full path to the program. The same substitutions (percnt; n, percnt; {foo} as with execute command are performed on the command line.
Be cautious with this action, as it will easily mess up your messages if the filter program returns garbage or extra lines.
Remove Header
Will remove all header fields with the given name from the message. This is useful mainly for removing bogus Reply-To: headers.
Add Header
If no such field is already present this will add a new header field with the given name and value to the message; if there already is a header field with that name, it is overwritten with the given value; if there are already multiple headers with the given name (eg; Received: headers), an arbitrary one of them is overwritten and the others are left unchanged -- this is a known limitation. You may want to combine this filter with the remove header filter above to make sure that there are no other headers with that name in the message.
Rewrite Header
Will scan the given header field, modify its contents and write it back. The search string is always interpreted as a case-sensitive regular expression. The replacement string is inserted literally except for occurrences of\, $n and ${nn}, where n is a positive (single-digit, except for the third form) number or 0. These constructs are interpreted as back references to substrings captured with parentheses in the search string.
Analogous restrictions as in the add header action apply here, too.
Filter Examples
Open up the Settings Configure Filters... dialog and click the New icon below the Available Filters list.
In the Filter Criteria area, type Priority in the text field of the first drop-down box, and type urgent in the text field of the second drop-down box.
Skip down to the Filter Actions area. Select Mark As from the first drop-down box. A new drop-down box containing a list of marker flags is shown to the right. Select Important from the drop-down box.
If I am subscribed to the (general) & kde; List, I could create a folder for the list (I will call it KDE-General) and use a filter to automatically transfer new messages from my inbox to my KDE-General folder if they are from the & kde; List. Here is how to create this filter:
Filtering a mailing list
Try if Message Create filter Filter on Mailing-List... can identify the mailing list (the name of the list should then appear in the menu item); in this case, this works and I am presented a filter that has List-Id contains & lt; kde. kde. orggt; preset. You select the desired destination folder from the folder pull-down menu in the Filter Action group and that is it.
If that does not work, think of a unique way of identifying the messages you want to filter. The (almost) unique property of my & kde; List messages is that they always contain kde@kde. org in the To: or CC: field. It is only almost unique, because this fails for cross-posted messages.
Select Settings Configure Filters....
Press the New button to create an empty filter. It will appear as lt; unknowngt;.
In the Filter Criteria area, select lt; recipientsgt; from the first drop-down box, contains from the second drop-down box, and type kde@kde. org in the text field.
Skip down to the Filter Actions section. Select file into folder from the first drop-down box. A new drop-down box containing a list of folders will appear. Select the folder that you want the filtered messages to be transferred to. For this example, you would select KDE-General from the drop-down box.
You may find that you need to use more powerful criteria to properly filter your messages; for example, you may only want to filter the & kde; List messages that are written by your friend Fred Johnson & lt; fj@anywhere. comgt;. This is where the rest of the matching criteria section comes into play:
Extending the filter
Open up the Configure Filters... window and select the filter you just created.
Since you want to filter all messages that have kde@kde. org in the To: or CC: field and that are from Fred, check the Match all of the following radio button.
Now, go to the second search rule and select the following from the pull-down menus: From, contains. Now, type fj@anywhere. com in the text field.
You now have a filter that transfers all & kde; List messages that are from fj@anywhere. com.
Filter Optimization
Check the order of your filters:
Filter Log
If you want to verify that your filters work as intended, you can open a viewer for the filter log via Tools Filter Log Viewer....

Be careful with the Delete mail from server option since once a mail is deleted on the server there is no way to get it back.

The Confirmation Dialog
Using Multiple Accounts
Multiple accounts are used to check for messages from more than one email address and/ or mail server. Select Settings Configure & kmail;... and click on the Network page to add or change your account settings. See the Getting started section for more information on the settings in the Network page.
To check for messages from a particular account, use the File Check Mail In submenu to select the account to check for mail. You can also press the mouse button on the Check Mail icon for some time to get a list of accounts.
Signing and Encrypting Messages with PGP or GnuPG
This is a short introduction on how to setup & kmail; 's PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) support; it gives some hints on the use of PGP too. It is written for people who are beginners in this area; if you are familiar with the use of PGP, you can skip most of the steps. This documentation, and the & kmail; user interface, generally talk only about PGP, but it applies to both PGP and GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard), (although some GnuPG command-line parameters may be different.)
Please also check out the FAQ; item about PGP.
& kmail; has to rely on PGP's output; this output is often different between different versions of PGP, so it is important that you test if encryption really works with your setup before you start using it seriously. & kmail; might not warn you if something fails -- enable Show signed/ encrypted text after composing.
To setup and use PGP support in & kmail; it is necessary to have PGP installed and set up properly; of course, we cannot give you a full introduction of PGP here. We will only mention the steps you have to do to get PGP going. For details you should have a look at the excellent PGP documentation or The GNU Privacy Handbook.
It is certainly a good idea to study this documentation as well as an introduction into public key cryptography (eg; out of the PGP 6.5. x package): there you can learn a lot about the basic concepts, which will help you to understand what is going on; also, many security related issues you should know about are discussed there.
Now, let us start.
Preconditions
& kmail; expects that your PGP binary is called pgp; in the case of GnuPG, it expects the binary to be called gpg. If this is not the case for you, just make a symlink.
If you have not done so, you have to generate a key pair (secret and public key) for your identity. You must do this at the command line: use pgp -kg or gpg --gen-key: & kmail; has no internal support for pgp's key generation at this time. The identity (normally your name followed by your email address within brackets, such as John Doe & lt; john@example. comgt;) and your passphrase are important for the co-operation between & kmail; and PGP.
PGP -Related Settings in & kmail;
Select the OpenPGP tab on the Security settings page; there you will find the following options:
Encryption tool
Here you can choose if you want to use PGP, GnuPG or no encryption software at all; of course, the program you select has to be installed on your system (it is also important to select the correct version.)
Keep passphrase in memory
When this option is off, & kmail; will ask for your passphrase each time you sign a message (before sending) or select an encrypted message; if you turn this option on, & kmail; will remember your passphrase from after your first successful input until you finish your & kmail; session. The passphrase is stored in memory and not written to the hard disk. If you use one of the Crypto-Plugins or if you use GnuPG with the gpg-agent then an external program will ask for your passphrase and optionally remember it for some time.
Always encrypt to self
If this option is off and you want to send an encrypted message to somebody, then you cannot read this message any longer after you have composed and encrypted it. Turn this option on to keep sent encrypted messages readable for you too.
Show signed/ encrypted text after composing
This will show you the result of encrypting and signing before the message gets sent; this way, you can still cancel sending if encrypting failed. It is strongly recommended to use this option.
This lets you toggle whether to automatically sign your messages by default; of course, it is still possible to send unsigned messages by deselecting the icon in the composer window.
Now you are able to sign outgoing messages; to let people send you encrypted messages and to let them verify your signature you must send them your public key or upload your public key to a public PGP key server so that they can fetch your key from there. To send encrypted messages to other people or to verify their signed messages you will need their public keys; you can store your public key(s) on a public PGP key server such as http: / /www. cam. ac. uk. pgp. net/ pgpnet/.
Sign your Messages
You can compose your message as usual in the composer window of & kmail;. Before you send the message, check the Sign Message icon on the toolbar of the composer window; then, you can send the message. The identity you are using to write the current message needs to be connected to an OpenPGP Key in the Identity section of the Configure dialog. To sign the message, & kmail; needs to know your PGP passphrase: if you did not select Keep passphrase in memory in the Security section, & kmail; will ask you for it; otherwise, if you have already given the phrase to & kmail;, it will sign the message without any further prompt.
Encrypt your Messages
To send an encrypted message to somebody of whom you have a public key, you simply create the message in the composer window. Before you send the message, check the Encrypt Message button in the toolbar of the composer window; note that you might not have to check the button if Automatically encrypt messages whenever possible is selected in & kmail; 's configuration (see above). Then send the message.
As mentioned above, you will not be able to read your own encrypted sent messages if you do not check Always encrypt to self in the settings' Security page.
Send your Public Key
Prepare a message to the person to whom you want to send your public key; then, choose, in the composer window's menu, Attach Attach My Public Key: this will attach the public key you defined for the current identity to the message. Now you can send the message.
Remember that it is not safe at all if you sign the message to make sure that the receiver will get the correct key: there can be a man-in-the-middle attack, as somebody can change the key and sign the message with that other key. That is why the recipient should verify the attached key by checking the key's fingerprint against the one he received in a secure way from you; have a look at the PGP documentation for further details.
You received an encrypted Message
All you have to do is to select the message in & kmail;. You will be prompted for your passphrase; then, & kmail; will try to decrypt the message and show you the plain text if the message had been encrypted with your public key: if not, then you will not be able to read it. & kmail; stores the messages encrypted, so nobody can read these messages without knowing your passphrase.
Receiving a Public Key
You can receive a public key as an attachment or via http, ftp or a floppy. Before you can use this key to encrypt a message to the owner of the key, you should verify the key (check its fingerprint or look for trusted signatures); then, you can add this key to your public keyring by typing pgp -ka filename at the command line (if you are using PGP) or by typing gpg --import filename at the command line (if you are using GnuPG). If the key is not certified with a trusted signature you cannot use it to encrypt messages unless you have signed the key with your key.

Welcome to & kate;, a programmer's text editor for & kde; version 4 and above. Some of & kate; 's many features include configurable syntax highlighting for languages ranging from C and C++ to & HTML; to bash scripts, the ability to create and maintain projects, a multiple document interface (MDI), and a self-contained terminal emulator.
But & kate; is more than a programmer's editor. Its ability to open several files at once makes it ideal for editing & UNIX; 's many configuration files. This document was written in & kate;.

Introduction
First enable the Insert Command plugin by using the Settings Configure & kate;... dialog and checking kate; InsertCommand in the Application Plugins section and close the dialog.
Onscreen Fundamentals
By default, the command will be run in the working folder of the kate process, which is usually your home folder. This can be changed in the configuration page for the plugin.
Note that any shell command that requires user input (for example passwd) or uses a ncurses interface or something similar (for example top) will fail to produce the expected output.
Configuration
To configure the Insert Command plugin, open the & kate; configuration dialog from the Settings Configure & kate;... menu and choose Plugins Insert Command.
The following configuration options are available:
Number of commands to remember
This setting is presented as a spinbox which you can set to the number of commands to be remembered. Any number from 0 to 99 is legal. Default is 20.
Default Working Folder
This setting, presented as a set of radio buttons, allows you to decide how the working folder of a command is chosen. The options are the working folder of the & kate; process (usually your home folder when & kate; is started from the K menu), the folder of the document (if any, otherwise the above option is used) or the working folder of the last command run in the plugin.

& amor; is a small animation which sits on top of your active window.
KDE
kdetoys
amor
helper
assistant
Introduction
What's & amor;?
& amor; is an acronym which stands for Amusing Misuse of Resources. It is actually an animation which sits on top of your active window. In its default configuration, & amor; takes the form of a yellow spot which performs many tricks. & amor; also has many different themes which change the appearance and behavior of the animation.
Since & amor; works with the & kde; window manager & kwin;, the application will only work from within & kde;. It is possible that & amor; would work from within another & kde; -compliant window manager, but none are known to work at the time of this writing.
Configuration
Configuring & amor;
To configure & amor;, click on the animation using your & RMB;. A menu will appear containing three items: Options..., About..., and Quit. Choose Options... to configure & amor;
General Options
The following settings for & amor; can be changed from the Options dialog:
This determines the appearance and behavior of & amor;. Themes are described in the next section.
Offset
This slider controls where the animation appears in relation to the top of the active window. The default middle setting will place the animation right above the window title bar, whereas setting the slider all the way to the top or bottom will result in the animation appearing a fair distance above or below the title bar, respectively.
Setting this slider to a lower setting will allow the animation to be visible even when the active window is maximized.
Always on top
Checking this option will cause the animation to always appear in front of any existing windows on the screen, including the panel.
Show random tips
If checked, the animation will display various & kde; -related tips at random intervals.
Allow application tips
Any & kde; application can be designed to display helpful tips via & amor;. If this option is checked, and an appropriate application is the active window, the animation will display tips for that application.
At the time of this writing, no & kde; applications make use of this functionality.
& amor; Themes
& amor; comes with many built-in themes, which change the appearance and behavior of the animation. In addition, it is possible to create new & amor; themes. The built-in themes for & amor; are described in the table below
Available & amor; Themes
Description
Multi-talented Spot
This is the default theme for & amor;, and also the one with the most tricks. This theme was created by & Martin. R. Jones;. The jet-pack, beaming, and fire animations were contributed by Mark Grant.
Spooky Ghost
A ghost theme based-on the & kde; ghostview icon. Spooky Ghost was created by & Martin. R. Jones;.
Crazy Eyes
This theme consists of a moving pair of eyes, and was created by Jean-Claude Dumas.
Bonhomme
A stick-figure animation, created by Jean-Claude Dumas.
Neko
Neko is a cat theme by Chris Spiegel. The graphics are originally from Oneko, which was written by Masayuki Koba.
Oneko is a small application which features a cat chasing the mouse cursor. The application appears to no longer be maintained, but the source code from the last version is still available.
Tux
This theme features Tux, the & Linux; mascot. The actual graphics come from a Lemmings -style game called Pingus. The Tux theme was created by Frank Pieczynski.
Little Worm
A small inchworm theme. Created by Bartosz Trudnowski for his wife.
Little Billy
A static image taken from the game XBill.

A General Introduction
ROLES_OF_TRANSLATORS
& koffice; is an integrated office suite for the K Desktop Environment (kde;).
KDE
KOffice
Introduction
& koffice; components
& koffice; is an integrated office suite for the K Desktop Environment (kde;). & koffice; currently consists of the following components:
& kword; (a frames-based wordprocessor)
& kspread; (a spreadsheet application)
& kpresenter; (screen and slide presentations)
& kivio; (a flowchart application)
& karbon14; (a vector drawing application)
& krita; (a pixel based drawing application)
& kchart; (a charts/ graphs generation application)
& kformula; (an editor for mathematical formulae)
Because these components are based on the KParts component model, & koffice; components are designed to work very well with each other. Any & koffice; component can be embedded in another & koffice; document. For instance, you can insert a spreadsheet which you created in & kspread; directly into a & kword; document. In this way, complex, compound documents can be created using & koffice;.
This manual only covers the general features of & koffice;, those that are common to most or all components in the suite. For detailed information about the different components, have a look at the respective manual.
Overview of & koffice; features
Integration
& koffice; Technology
KParts - the building blocks of & koffice;
Each & koffice; application is designed to fulfill very specific needs. For example, & kspread; is a program for manipulating spreadsheets, while & kword; is a program for word processing. By focusing on a specific area, each program aims for perfection in exactly this area. However, depending on what you do with & koffice;, you'll often want to take advantage of functionality provided by different applications, but in the same document.
Suppose that you are preparing a document in & kword; and want to illustrate some point using a table. While & kword; provides its own functionality for the insertion of tables, this may not be enough for your needs. For example, you may want to use certain currency data formats or to do calculations using spreadsheet formulae. Now, some & kword; programmer certainly could try to implement this functionality. However, & kword; would never be as good as & kspread; in this field; and if it tried to implement all the functionality you might possibly need, it would end up becoming unreasonably complex and the source code would become impossible to maintain.
The alternative to this is KParts. Its philosophy is simple: let every application do what it does best.
Compound documents with KParts
With KParts, your documents can use all functionality offered by all & koffice; applications. You can take advantage of this by inserting so-called parts into your document. Every one of those parts is essentially another document, that is, a document within a document.
In the example mentioned above, you would simply insert a & kspread; part into your & kword; document. Then, whenever you edit your table, & kspread; would take control in the background. Control would return to & kword; when you stop working on the table and start working on text again. The only change you would notice is that the toolbars and menus, while editing the table, reflect the functionality of & kspread; instead of that of & kword;. This ability to include the functionality of one application in another is called embedding.
Using KParts in your document
If you have never worked with compound documents, you may find them confusing at first. The following step-by-step instructions show you that using KParts is just as easy as working with a single application.
Inserting a & kspread; part into a & kword; application
Start & kword;. You can do that either from the panel or by typing kword at the command line.
Start a new, blank document. You may want to type some sample text.
Select Insert Object Frame Spreadsheets. You'll notice that the mouse cursor has changed to a cross. This form of the cursor indicates that you are supposed to select an area.
Press the & LMB; mouse button where you want the upper left corner of your table to be, hold it and drag it to the lower right corner. Release the button. Now a dialog appears that gives you the possibility to insert an existing document or to create a new one. Create a blank worksheet. That's it--you're done.
Easy, is n't it? You should now see a table frame in your & kword; document. Now, doubleclick inside the table to see what happens. You'll notice that:
Your menubars and toolbars have changed. They now reflect those of & kspread;.
Your table frame now contains the elements of a & kspread; view, with scrollbars, a tab bar for the selection of tables, & etc;
Try editing the table. You'll see that it's not different from using & kspread;. In fact you are using & kspread;.
Now click somewhere into your & kword; document, outside of the table area. The menubars and toolbars should change back to those of & kword;, the elements of the & kspread; view should disappear. Your table stays and still reflects all of the changes you've applied to it.
KParts are easy to use. Try inserting other parts or even parts in parts.
Configuring & koffice; and Your System
While & koffice; should work quite nice out of the box, there may well be some things to optimize to get the best out of & koffice;. This chapter shows you what you might want to do to achieve the best results with your new office suite and make it suite your needs. & koffice; is highly configurable, even down to detailed toolbar and menu layout.
Optimizing Font Output
Fonts are a difficult topic on & X-Window;. In this section we'll cover some problems that are frequently reported by people using & koffice;. Some problems are not just & koffice; s fault, but depend on your system configuration, which is why you may need to modify system configuration files in order to solve them. If you do n't have access to the root account on your system, please ask your system operator about this and point him or her to this manual. As the topic of fonts is too complex to cover all of it here, you may want to consult the Font HOWTO from which I've taken the following information. You will find more details there.
How to Get Nicely Scaled Fonts on Screen
STUFF
How to Get Correct Printout
While & koffice; automatically can handle all X11 fonts on screen, printout can pose a problem: on most systems, printing is done via ghostscript. Now, while & koffice; knows the font names used by & X-Window;, it does normally not know the font names used by ghostscript. & koffice; tries to guess these names, which unfortunately does n't work all of the time.
This problem can be solved, although this is not that easy. Actually, maybe you are using a distribution which has done most work for you already (so if you have no reason to complain about printout you can skip this section). What you have to do is to tell ghostscript how to translate the (guessed) font names & koffice; uses to its own font names. This can be done by adding lines to a file called Fontmap. An alias line in Fontmap looks like the following example:
An alias in the ghostscript Fontmap
/ Algerian-Roman / Algerian;
Please note that a space before the ';' is mandatory. In this example, Algerian-Roman is the name & koffice; uses for Algerian. You'll have to add such lines for the fonts & koffice; does n't display correctly. To make this task easier, Donovan Rebbechi has written a perl script you can find at http: / /pegasus. rutgers. edu/ ~elflord/ font_howto/ kwdfont. Assuming that you have a fontfile / usr/ share/ ghostscript/ fonts/ fontfile. ttf you'll enter kwdfont / usr/ share/ ghostscript/ fonts/ fontfile. ttf to get the appropriate aliases. The script should mork in most cases. As mentioned, you should have a look at the Font HOWTO for more accurate and in-depth information.
Customizing the & koffice; & GUI;
While & koffice; comes out of the box with a & GUI; (graphical user interface) that should suit most people's needs, there are good reasons why you may want to change the way the programs look.
My mother, for example, is a bit afraid of buttons and menu entries she does n't understand. To tailor & koffice; to her needs, I reduced the & GUI; to a bare minimum of functionality. As she only needs to write letters and use certain templates, there is no need for much more functionality than saving, loading, printing, & etc;
Thanks to the action concept of & Qt; and & kde;, you can freely customize & koffice; menubars and tool bars. Unfortunately, at the moment, there are no easy-to-use dialogs to do this. & koffice; stores its & GUI; configuration in & XML; files and you'll have to edit those. Hopefully, this situation will change in the future; for now, you'll need some basic knowledge of how an & XML; document works (or & HTML;, which is a subset of & XML;). [The action concept needs to be discussed in more detail -- kt.]
Normally, each & koffice; application has at least two of those & XML; files: one describing the & GUI; of the shell (basically, that's what you see if there is no document open) and one describing the & GUI; of the respective part (that's what you see normally). For example, for & kword;, these two & XML; files are named kword_shell. rc and kword. rc.
Here's a simple example of such an rc-file.
An example of a simple rc-file
& lt; !DOCTYPE QConfig & gt; lt; qconfiggt; & lt; menubargt; & lt; menu name="Edit"gt; lt; textgt; Editlt; /textgt; & lt; action name="edit_cut"/ gt; & lt; action name="edit_copy"/ gt; & lt; action name="edit_paste"/ gt; & lt; separator/ gt; & lt; action name="edit_find"/ gt; & lt; /menugt; & lt; menu name="Insert"gt; lt; textgt; Insertlt; /textgt; & lt; action name="insert_picture"/ gt; & lt; action name="insert_clipart"/ gt; & lt; menu name="Variable"gt; lt; textgt; Variablelt; /textgt; & lt; action name="insert_var_datefix"/ gt; & lt; action name="insert_var_datevar"/ gt; & lt; /menugt; & lt; /menugt; & lt; /menubargt; & lt; toolbarsgt; & lt; toolbar name="edit_toolbar "position="right"gt; & lt; action name="edit_cut"/ gt; & lt; action name="edit_copy"/ gt; & lt; action name="edit_paste"/ gt; & lt; /toolbargt; & lt; /toolbarsgt; & lt; /qconfiggt;

Installation
System Requirements
In order to install and use & koffice; you must have:
A functioning & UNIX; system (for example, & Linux; or BSD) with a configured & X-Window; (for example, XFree86 or X. Org).
The & Qt; 3.3 libraries from Trolltech. See www. trolltech. com for more information.
The K Desktop Environment 3.3 (kde; 3.3) or newer. & koffice; cannot be compiled with earlier versions of & kde;. Information on obtaining and installing & kde; can be found at: & kde-http;
Permission to install software on your computer. If you are on a stand-alone system, this should not be a problem. However, if you are using a networked computer, check with your administrator first.
Please note that, while you need the & kde; 3.3 (or newer) libraries on your system, you can still use & koffice; in a different desktop environment (for example, XFCE or GNOME).
If you plan on compiling & koffice; from source code you will also need:
automake 1.6.1 or later. This can be downloaded from: ftp: / /ftp. gnu. org/ pub/ gnu/ automake/
autoconf 2.53 or later. This can be downloaded from: ftp: / /ftp. gnu. org/ pub/ gnu/ autoconf/
A C++ compiler which supports exceptions, preferably a recent version of GCC. (See http: / /gcc. gnu. org for info about getting and installing it.)
Once you have determined that your system meets these requirements, you should decide whether you want to compile the source code or install from pre-compiled binary packages.
If you want to obtain the most current binary version of & koffice;, you can find more information by following this link: Getting Binary Packages.
If pre-compiled binaries are not available for your system, you can download the source code and compile it yourself. Instructions on where to obtain the current source code (and what to do with the source code once you have it) can be found by following this link: Getting the source code.
Please see the koffice; homepage for further details. That is where you can always find the most up-to-date information on both source and binary distributions!
Getting Binary Packages
You can download the most current binaries from:
or from one of many mirror sites. The current list of mirror sites can be found at:
http: / /www. kde. org/ mirrors. html
It is important that you use a binary package which is compatible with your system. If you use the & Linux; operating system and are unable to find a binary package at the & koffice; web site or one of its mirrors, you may be able to obtain one from the website of your distribution.
From Binary Packages
To install & koffice; from precompiled binaries, you should:
Ensure your computer has all of the required software installed and in working condition (excluding & koffice; of course). You can find the system requirements by following this link: System Requirements.
Download the & koffice; binary (or binaries) into a temporary folder.
If the filename ends in. rpm (RedHat; Package Management file), & koffice; can be installed with the following command:
$rpm -U filename
If the filename ends in. deb (Debian Package file), & koffice; can be installed with the following command:
$dpkg -i filename
If the filename ends in. tar. gz or. tgz (a tarball file), & koffice; can be installed with the following commands:
$cd / $tar -xzvf filename
That's all. & koffice; should now be installed on your system.
If you have a graphical front-end for package management, such as & kpackage; or GnoRPM, installed on your system, you may find that more convenient to use than a command line. Consult the program's documentation to find out how to install with it.
Getting Source Code
You can download the current source code from: http: / /koffice. org/ or from one of many mirror sites. The current list of mirror sites can be found at:
From Source Code
If you want to build & koffice; from source code, you should:
Ensure your computer has all the required software installed and in working condition (excluding & koffice; of course). You can find the system requirements by following this link: System Requirements.
Download the & koffice; source file into a temporary folder.
$rpm -U filename
If the filename ends in. src. tar. gz or. src. tgz (a tarball file), the source code for & koffice; can be installed with:
$tar -xzvf filename
The source code for & koffice; should now be installed on your system.

Introduction
It should be noted that both the developer of this application, and the author of this document are most familiar with & CUPS; as a printing system. At the time of writing, & CUPS; is the best supported printing subsystem, and it is the best documented.
This handbook is a work in progress, and later versions of the & kdeprint; software and editions of this handbook will support and explore more closely other printing systems.
In the meantime, even if your printing subsystem is not yet well covered, you are encouraged to explore the Printing Manager module in & kcontrol;, and you will find its operation to hopefully be fairly self evident, no matter what printing subsystem you use.

Print Server Configuration: CUPS
Start the print server configuration (now that you have chosen & CUPS;, this is equivalent to the configuration of the & CUPS; daemon) by clicking on the appropriate button. You can find it by moving the mouse slowly over the buttons and reading the tooltips. It should be the 11th from the left, or third from the right; its icon is a wrench.
The & CUPS; Server Configuration window pops up. It gives you a structured view of all the settings that apply to the & CUPS; daemon. The configuration file for that daemon is normally located in / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf. This is a plain ASCII file with a syntax similar to the configuration file of the Apache web server. It is a good idea to create a backup copy, just in case something goes wrong with the configuration through & kdeprint; /CUPS; Server Configuration dialogs:
cp / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf. bak
As this graphical user interface to edit the configuration file is such a new feature, you should have the second chance of resorting to the original file. So back it up, please.
Quick Help
One very nice feature is the Quick Help available. If you click on the little question mark (What's this?) on your window title bar, you'll see the cursor changing its form. Now click on a cupsd configuration setting field to find out what it means and what your options are. In most cases you should understand the meaning immediately, otherwise turn to the excellent & CUPS; documentation. (If your & CUPS; Daemon is running, you have it online on your own host at http: / /localhost:631/ documentation. html.
Longer Help
For the best, most detailed and most recent information you should always refer to the original & CUPS; documentation. & CUPS; is, much like & kde; in a rapid development process. There are constantly new features being added. New features might for times be only configurable by directly editing the configuration files. The & kdeprint; & GUI; might not have caught up with & CUPS; development.

& CUPS; options presently not available through & kcontrol;
This chapter gives you some hints about further configuration possibilities which may not be available through the & kdeprint; & GUI; interface to & CUPS;.
Overview of provided features
All of the most often used features and functions & CUPS; provides are supported in & kdeprint;.
Printer management is supported: add, remove, modify, configure, test, disable, enable...
Job management is supported: cancel, hold, release, move to different printer
Print options: for full control as provided by & CUPS;.
Where to find help when using & CUPS;
A lot of information about the inner workings of & CUPS; is available through the web interface, which & CUPS; will always support. It works with any browser (yes, even text-based ones). Just go to http: / /localhost:631/ for a start. There you find a link to locally available & CUPS; documentation in HTML and PDF if you are new to & CUPS;.
& CUPS; is accessible through other means than & kdeprint;: commandline and browser are two native & CUPS; interfaces. The many commandline utilities add up to the most complete control you have on & CUPS;. The web interface is only a subset of all available configuration or control options.
This is also true for & kdeprint;. Generally, as & CUPS; develops, most new features will first be implemented through the commandline. Be sure to check the latest versions of the man pages for & CUPS; to stay up-to-date with new features after you install a new version.
Depending on your update method for & CUPS;, your active configuration file might not have been re-placed by a new one; thus your new, more capable & CUPS; -daemon might not have been told by the old configuration file about the new features to use.
A complete list of available files and man pages should always be in the & CUPS; Software Administrator Manual (http: / /localhost:631/ sam. html#FILES. In the & konqueror; & URL; /location field, type man: / lpadmin and man: / cupsd. conf to find out about the most important command and configuration file. You knew already about & konqueror; 's nice abilities to show you the traditional & UNIX; man pages, did n't you? Read this. From there you find more interesting hints and links to other man pages and documentation.
How to find & CUPS; related man pages
Here is a way to find out which & CUPS; related man pages there are on your system:
kurt@transmeta: ~ > apropos cups cups-calibrate (8)- ESP Printer Calibration Tool lpstat (1) - print cups status information cups-lpd (8) - receive print jobs + report printer status to lpd clients classes. conf (5) - class configuration file for cups backend (1) - cups backend transmission interfaces filter (1) - cups file conversion filter interfaces cups-polld (8) - cups printer polling daemon mime. types (5) - mime type description file for cups cupsd (8) - common unix printing system daemon lpadmin (8) - configure cups printers and classes cupsd. conf (5) - server configuration file for cups mime. convs (5) - mime type conversion file for cups printers. conf (5) - printer configuration file for cups mime. convs (5) - mime type conversion file for cups cups-polld (8) - cups printer polling daemon lpstat (1) - print cups status information backend (1) - cups backend transmission interfaces mime. types (5) - mime type description file for cups cupsd (8) - common unix printing system daemon lpadmin (8) - configure cups printers and classes printers. conf (5) - printer configuration file for cups cupsd. conf (5) - server configuration file for cups filter (1) - cups file conversion filter interfaces
Outside & kdeprint;: Hints & Tips Tricks with & CUPS; on the Commandline
Here are a few examples of options that are presently only available if you use the commandline.
Allowing or denying printer access for certain users
When installing (or modifying) a printer through the command line, you can either deny or allow the usage of that printer to certain users:
lpadmin -p HeidelbergDigimaster9110 -v lpd: / 10.160.16.99/ mqueue -u allow: kurt, sylvi, hansjoerg -E -P / home/ kurt/ PPDs/ DVHV. ppd
will allow the usage of this (believe me: very nice and also very professional) printer to only the three mentioned users and at the same time deny it to all others. If another user wants to print on the DigiMaster via this & CUPS; server, he will receive an error message along the lines client-error-not-possible.
lpadmin -p HeidelbergDigimaster9110 -v lpd: / 10.160.16.99/ mqueue -u deny: tackat, boss, waba -E -P / home/ kurt/ PPDs/ DVHV. ppd
will deny the usage of this same printer to the three mentioned users and at the same time allow it to all others. If denied user wants to print on the DigiMaster via this & CUPS; server, he will receive an error message along the lines client-error-not-possible.
Only one of the two options may be used at one time; at present there is no support to have a similar option in a per-group based way. This will be implemented in the future.
Imposing Quotas for certain printers
Sometimes you want to impose quotas for certain printers. With quotas you can set upper limits for the number of pages or the amount of data to be printed over a certain period to a certain printer.
Quotas can be set with the -o option when installing a printer with the lpadmin command, or afterwards for an already existing printer. Following are some guidelines (which are missing at the time of writing in the, official & CUPS; documentation):
With & CUPS; you may have pagecount- and filesize-based quotas for individual printers.
Quotas are calculated for each user individually (so a single set of limits applies to all users for the printer concerned).
Quotas include banner pages (if those are used).
This means: you can limit every user to 20 pages per day on an expensive printer, but you cannot limit every user except Kurt or root.
There are job-k-limit, job-page-limit, and job-quota-period options to give when setting up a printer.
job-quota-period sets a time interval for quota computing (intervals are determined in seconds; so a day is 60x60x24=86.400, a week is 60x60x24x7=604,800, and a month is 60x60x24x30=2.592.000 seconds.)
For quotas to be enforced, the time-period plus at least one job-limit must be set to non-zero.
The default value of 0 for job-k-limit specifies that there is no limit.
The default value of 0 for job-page-limit specifies that there is no limit.
The default value of 0 for job-quota-period specifies that the limits apply to all jobs that have been printed by a user that are still known to the system.
Working Examples:
Working, as both, time-period plus one or both job-limits are defined
lpadmin -p danka_infotec_4850 -o job-quota-period=604800 -o job-k-limit=1024
This sets a limit of a file size of 1 MB (in total) for each user of existing printer danka_infotec_4850 during one week.
lpadmin p danka_infotec_4105 -o job-quota-period=604800 -o job-page-limit=100
This sets a limit of 100 pages (in total) for each user of existing printer danka_infotec_4105 during one week.
lpadmin -p danka_infotec_P450 -o job-quota-period=604800 -o job-k-limit=1024 -o job-page-limit=100
This sets a combined limit of 1 MB (in total) and 100 pages (in total) for each user of existing printer danka_infotec_P450 during one week. Whichever limit is reached first will take effect.

Related Error Messages
Once a user reaches his quota limit, he'll get a client-error-not-possible message, if he wants to print.
Installing a raw printer
There are different ways to define a raw printer. One comfortable one is to use the lpadmin command. Just do n't define a & PPD; file to be used for that printer and it will be a raw one:
lpadmin -p Raw_Danka_infotec -E -v lpd: / /10.160.16.137/ PORT1
Raw printer queues are those which do n't touch the print file to transform it to a different file format. You need this for example when printing from & Windows; clients via Samba through a & CUPS; server to a PCL printer: in this case the & Windows; side printer driver would generate the finished print file format for the target printer and filtering it through & CUPS; filters would only harm the purpose. Under certain circumstances (if you want to make sure that the file goes to the printer unfiltered by & CUPS;) the lpadmin without a & PPD; comes in handy.
Troubleshooting & CUPS; in & kdeprint;
This section of the & kdeprint; Handbook will live from the readers' feedback. Here is just a small beginning.
Error Messages
What does the error client-error-bad-request mean?
The user sent a file to the & CUPS; which the server could not process. You get this also upon sending an empty file.
And client-error-not-possible?
User is either not allowed to print to a certain printer or has achieved his quota (based on file size and/ or page number)
How about client-error-not-found?
The user tried to access a nonexistent resource on the & CUPS; server, such as trying to print a nonexistent file, or one that you are denied permission to read.
Questions and Answers
Why ca n't I re-start my jobs?
To be able to re-start your completed jobs from the web interface, you need a setting in the / etc/ cups/ cupsd. conf file: set PreserveJobFiles True.
How do I get rid of the long list of completed jobs in the web interface?
TODO
How does page accounting work?
& CUPS; does the print accounting by passing nearly every job through the pstops filter. This one does, amongst other things, the page counting. Output of this filter there may be piped into other filters (like pstoraster -- > rastertopcl) or sent to the printer directly (if it is a & PostScript; printer).
In any case, this works for network, parallel, serial or USB printers the same. For pstops to work, it needs DSC, Document Structuring Convention compliant & PostScript; (or near-equivalent) as input. So it calculates the pages during filtering on the print server and writes info about every single page (what time, which user, which job-ID and -name, which printer, how many copies of which pages of the document, how many kilo-bytes?) into / var/ log/ cups/ page_log.
By the way: on my personal wishlist is a hack of webalizer to read and analyze the page_log and give a similar output. Anyone?
However, it is not giving correct results in the following cases:
The printer jams and maybe therefore throw away the job (real live experience; or maybe throwing away the job because of problems with the data format)
Jobs printed as raw are always counted as size of 1 page (and maybe multiple copies).
Therefore the page accounting of & CUPS; is only an approximation (in many cases an excellent or at least good one, in others a quite poor one). The only reliable print count is the one done by the internal printer counter. (Because this is the one you pay for, if you are on a click price or similar.) Some, by far not most, printers can be queried remotely for that information via SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). That means, in a bigger network with many different printers there is just no completely reliable and accurate page accounting tool!
Why does n't page-accounting work with & Windows; clients?
From & Windows; clients jobs nearly always need to be sent as raw. Why? If & CUPS; works as a print server for & Windows; clients using the original native & Windows; driver for the target print device, this guarantees the correct formatting of the job on the clients already; therefore the server should not touch it and print raw; therefore no filtering is started (and this is not even possible as the input from the clients is not & PostScript; as pstops expects; hence no page-count other than the default 1.
How do I get a list of available options for a given printer or a & PPD; file?
See the man page for the lpoptions command. You may investigate a & CUPS; -enabled box about any option of its available printers. There is no need to have the printer installed locally. As long as the printer is available locally (through the & CUPS; printer browsing feature), it will also work remote.
To query for a printers' option typing lpoptions -p HitachiDDP70MicroPress -l will give a long listing of all available options as read from the & PPD; file for the given Hitachi-Printer (in my case installed on remote server transmeta). Remote server Transmeta and its & CUPS; daemon as well as the localhost's & CUPS; daemon need to be up and running for this to succeed.
How do I read the listing retrieved by the lpoptions command?
You know that for & PostScript; printer manufacturers it is legal to define their own internal names and procedures even for standard & PostScript; options. As long as the driver is able to retrieve the option from the & PPD; and show it to the user in a way that he understands it everything is OK. But what do you do, if you want to use some obscure printer options on the command line? How do you find out its exact syntax?
Let's take an example. Looking at Hitachi's DDP70 printer and how it implements duplex printing is revealing somehow. How do you tell how to print double sided? duplex or Duplex? Or another name altogether?.
lpoptions -h transmeta -p Hitachi_DDP70_ClusterPrintingSystem -l _BAR_ grep uplex
This leads to the output
TR-Duplex/ Duplex: False *True
This is to be interpreted like follows:
The name of the investigated option is TR-Duplex;
Behind the slash you see the translation of the option, as it should be shown in a & GUI; or Web interface (Duplex);
The option may take one of the two values False or True;
The present setting is True to be recognized by the marking with a star *.
To override the present default setting (duplex) and print a job in simplex, you need to use the following command:
lpr -P Hitachi_DDP70_ClusterPrintingSystem -o TR-Duplex=False / path/ to/ your/ printjob
How do I get a nicely formatted listing of available options for a given printer or & PPD;?
Use the lphelp command which may be installed on your system locally. There is not yet a man page for lphelp.
lphelp infotecP450
This lists the available options for the named printer. It is nicely formatted and does explain every available option and how to use it. You can query different printers' options at once:
lphelp infotec7410color DANKA_fullcolor_D2000 HP_ColorLaserJet8550
It also works for & PPD; files. Just specify the path to the & PPD;:
lphelp / home/ kurt/ PPDs/ HP-ColorLaserJet8550. ppd
Solving Problems
No system is perfect. Here are some commonly seen traps people have fallen into.
My printer named 3-lp-duplex shows erratic behavior. What's wrong?
The printer names used in & CUPS; shall start with a letter and may contain up to 128 letters, numbers or underscores. Using dashes may lead to problems. Speaking about naming: printer names in & CUPS; are not case sensitive. So a printer named Best_of_Danka will be the same as best_of_danka or BEST_OF_DANKA. (This is a requirement of & IPP;, which & CUPS; is fully compliant with).
Why do I get Unable to connect to SAMBA host: Success with my printer shares from & Windows; accessed via Samba?
Are the rights on the remote & Windows; box set correctly for you? Are you actually allowed to print on the & Windows; shared printer?
My files for printer lp sometimes mysteriously disappear and two days later I am told they got printed on a printer three floors below my office. What is going on?
Believe me, it is very unlikely that your printer is the only one with the name lp. Maybe & CUPS; is playing a trick on you. As you might have the setting ImplicitClasses On activated, & CUPS; tries to stuff all printers it sees on the network into a Class name lp. All jobs destined to lp are sent to this class and the first available member prints it. So if you had this nice fellow (who listened closely when you raved about & CUPS; and & kdeprint;) install & CUPS; and poke around the system... get the idea?
Take my advice: choose a unique name for any network printer! (Mind you, the one on your parallel port also turns out to be a network printer for the rest of the world if you do n't take care of your settings).

Caveats
& kdeprint; has been developed on a system using & CUPS; 1.1.6. & kdeprint; has been tested on other versions of & CUPS; and so far no incompatibilities are known. By the time of writing this Handbook, & CUPS; 1.1.9 is out with a few new features not yet supported by & kdeprint;. Of course you are able to access these features, but you will need to bypass & kdeprint; and use the & CUPS; command-line tools or edit configuration files manually. & kdeprint; 's development will go on and this Handbook strives to always be the best available user documentation resource for it.
Getting Started
Selecting Your Print Subsystem
You need to define your print subsystem, before you are able to install any printer with the & kdeprint; framework. There are two areas where you can define this: either in & kcontrol; (The Printing Manager section), or directly and on the fly from the print dialog.
Navigate to K Menu Preferences System Printing Manager. At the bottom you can see a button that lets you select which printing subsystem you want to use. In & kde; 2.2 you can choose from the following alternatives:
& CUPS; (Common & UNIX; Printing System)
Print through an external program (generic)
LPR (Standard BSD Print System)
Generic & UNIX; LPD print system (the default)
On its first startup, & kdeprint; will try an autodetection. This only works for:
& CUPS;, as it is checking first for a running & CUPS; daemon
LPD, as it is checking for a running LPD daemon, plus a printcap file.
The system you choose must be installed on your system prior to your selection. The author's personal recommendation is & CUPS;.
This file is not intended to be directly editable, and all available options can be set from the & kdeprint; & GUI;.
Working with the Printing Manager
Once you have chosen your preferred and installed print subsystem, you are ready to investigate, configure administer and work with this system through the & kdeprint; framework.
& kdeprint; 's Highlights
The Add Printer Wizard
A screenshot of the new Add Printer Wizard
Here's a screenshot of the Add Printer Wizard (this one is not very exciting yet; but...)
The wizard makes the installation and handling of the drivers a snap. Selecting, configuring and testing should be easy as never before on any & Linux; -like system.
Full Print Job Control
The Print Job Viewer is automatically started by & kprinter;. It may be docked into the & kde; panel (in the system tray). The Print Job Viewer allows full job management, if supported by the print subsystem.
You can:
Hold and release jobs,
Move pending jobs to another printer,
Cancel pending or processing jobs.
A screenshot of the & kdeprint; PrintJob Viewer
Modules for different print subsystems
& kdeprint; uses different modules to realize the interface to the possible print subsystems. Not all the modules are yet developed fully, but you will have basic printing functionality with:
LPD (BSD style)
LPRng (RedHat;, if you just use it's BSD style subset),
RLPR (a command-line LPR utility, which does n't need a printcap file.
external print commands (Netscape; like).
Most importantly, full support for & CUPS; is already there. Modules for other print subsystems, such as PLP, PPR and PDQ may be available later.
More & kdeprint; Goodies
Some specific features of & kdeprint; depend on the chosen print subsystem. This dependency might exist because those features are only implemented there; remember, & kdeprint; is an intermediate layer between & kde; applications, and the print subsystem, but it's no replacement for any print subsystem by itself. Such dependency may exist for another reason: that & kdeprint; has not yet implemented an interface to all the features of all the subsystems.
Print Preview
Special Printers
Amongst these additional & kdeprint; features are a few special or virtual printers:
These special printers may:
Print to PDF
Print to email
Send your document as an email attached PDF file.
Print to PS file
Save your document as a & PostScript; file.
Print to Fax
Send it through an available backend, such as Hylafax as a fax.
These special printers appear in the user print dialog just like normal printers. They are entirely configurable on a per-user basis.
Generic Pre-Filtering
There are a few useful filters already predefined. These are:
The multiple pages per sheet filter,
the enscript text filter,
and three filters to help print pamphlets.
Multiple Pages Per Sheet Filter
Enscript Text Filter
Pamphlet Printing Filters
& CUPS; Support: the Most Important Module in & kdeprint;
qtcups and kups & mdash; The Predecessors
qtcups was a graphical front end for the lp or lpr print commands as installed by & CUPS;. Using qtcups opened a dialog. This dialog let you comfortably select your printer and the print job options. qtcups worked from the command line, or from within applications, when the application in question had a configurable print command.
kups was a graphical wrapper to do the administration tasks for your & CUPS; server, and the & CUPS; daemon at the heart of it. You could add, delete, modify, configure, start, and stop printers. You could cancel, delete, move, stop and restart print jobs, and you could change the settings of the daemon, start, stop, and restart it.
& kdeprint; & mdash; The Heir
The & CUPS; Module in & kdeprint; now contains all (and more) functions that were provided by qtcups and kups in former & kde; versions.
& kprinter; & mdash; Graphical Print Command
& kdeprint; 's & CUPS; module gives you access to a graphical print command, like qtcups did before.
Plans for Future Development
In the future, & kdeprint; will become even better. It will do a better job of detecting your installed print subsystem itself. Already & kdeprint; is doing quite well in automatically sensing if you have & CUPS; on your system. But in many cases you will have to tell & kdeprint; what you are using, if you want to keep a legacy print system.
The most important improvement in the near future will be a completion of the LPRng plugin. This at present is still very basic. It is restricted to the pure classical LPD part of LPRng.
Also, you may be able to add printers directly from the print dialog to your system just in time, without going to & kcontrol; first.
Please contact Michael Goffioul at kdeprint@swing. be with any further user or developer suggestions.

Technical Overview
& kdeprint; is a new and revolutionary tool to give easy access to printing services for both & kde; users and & kde; developers.
A Brief Description of & kdeprint;
You can access the functions of & kdeprint; in different ways: through the Printing Manger in the & kcontrol;, through the kprinter command or through the dialog that pops up if you want to print.
What it is not
What it is
& kdeprint; -- Different Usage for Different People
& kdeprint; has different faces for different people.
What users and administrators can do with & kdeprint;
What & kde; developers can do with it...
What & kdeprint; offers to everybody...
& kdeprint; can use & CUPS; to support:
Querying the LAN for available printers,
Basic, Digest, and Certificate Authentication,
Access Control based on IP addresses, net addresses, netmasks, host- and domain names,
and 128-Bit TLS or SSL3 encryption of print data, to prevent eavesdropping, or at least make it much more difficult.
This makes & kdeprint; a much more robust and reliable solution than using the venerable LPD.
Basics About Printing
Printing is one of the more complicated chapters in IT technology.
Having to support ten application programs and a dozen printers, meant a system administrator had to deal with 120 drivers. So the development of unified interfaces between programs and printers became an urgent need.

Raster Images on Paper Sheets
RIP: From & PostScript; to Raster
Before the final raster images are put on paper cut-sheets, they have to be calculated somehow out of their abstract & PostScript; representation. This is a very computing-intensive process. It is called the Raster Imaging Process, more commonly RIP).
But what happens, if you are not lucky enough to have a & PostScript; printer available?
In other words, as you ca n't rely on the printer to understand and interpret the & PostScript; itself, the issue becomes quite a bit more complicated. You need software that tries to solve for you the issues involved.
Drivers and Filters in General
To produce rasterized bitmaps from & PostScript; input, the concept of filters is used by & ghostscript;. There are many different filters in & ghostscript;, some of them specialized for a certain model of printer. & ghostscript; filter devices have often been developed without the consent or support of the manufacturer concerned. Without access to the specifications and documentation, it was a very painstaking process to reverse engineer protocols and data formats.
& PostScript; is what most application programs produce for printing in & UNIX; and & Linux;. Filters are the true workhorses of any printing system there. Essentially they produce the right bitmaps from any & PostScript; input for non-PostScript; target engines.
Spoolers and Printing Daemons
Besides the heavy part of the filtering task to generate a print-ready bitmap, any printing software needs to use a SPOOLing mechanism: this is to line up different jobs from different users for different printers and different filters and send them accordingly to the destinations. The printing daemon takes care of all this.
Excursion: How CUPS uses the power of & PPD; s
& PPD; s were invented by Adobe to make it easy for manufacturers to implement their own features into & PostScript; printers, and at the same time retain a standard way of doing so. & PPD; s are well documented and described by Adobe. Their specification is a de-facto open standard.
Device Dependent Print Options
Where to get the & PPD; s for & PostScript; Printers
& CUPS; can use original & Windows; & PPD; s, distributed by the vendors in the case of & PostScript; printers. Those normally do n't cost any money, and they can be grabbed from any & Windows; computer with an installed & PostScript; driver for the model concerned, or from the disks provided with the printer. There are also several places on the web to download them.
How Special & PPD; s are Now Useful Even For Non-PostScript; Printers.
Now you know how & PostScript; -Printers can use & PPD; s. But what about non-PostScript; printers? & CUPS; has done a very good trick: by using the same format and data structure as the & PostScript; Printer Descriptions (PPD; s) in the & PostScript; world, it can describe the available print job options for non-PostScript; printers just the same. For its own special purposes & CUPS; just added a few special options (namely the line which defines the filter to be used for further processing of the & PostScript; file).
So, the developers could use the same software engine to parse the Printer Description Files for available options for all sorts of printers. Of course the & CUPS; developers could not rely on the non-PostScript; hardware manufacturers to suddenly develop & PPD; s. They had to do the difficult start themselves and write them from scratch. More than 1000 of these are available through the commercial version of & CUPS;, called ESP PrintPro.
Meanwhile there are a lot of & CUPS; -specific & PPD; s available. Even now those are in most cases not originating from the printer manufacturers, but from Free software developers. The & CUPS; folks proofed it, and others followed suit: where & Linux; and & UNIX; printing one or two years ago still was a kludge, it is now able to support a big range of printers, including 7-color inkjets capable of pushing them to Photo Quality output.
Different Ways to get & PPD; s for non-PostScript; Printers
You can get & PPD; s to be used with & CUPS; and non-PostScript; printers from different areas in the Web:
first, there is the repository at www. linuxprinting. org, which lets you generate a CUPS-O-Matic -PPD; online for any printer that had been supported by traditional & ghostscript; printing already. This helps you to switch over to & CUPS; with little effort, if you wish so. If your printer was doing well with the traditional way of & ghostscript; printing, take CUPS-O-Matic to plug your driver into the & CUPS; system and you'll have the best of both worlds.
second, there are & CUPS; -PPD; s for the more than 120 printer models, which are driven by the new universal stp driver. stp (stood originally for Stylus Photo) is now developed by the gimp-print project; it was started by Mike Sweet, the leading & CUPS; developer and is now available through gimp-print. sourceforge. net. This driver prints real Photo quality on many modern inkjets and can be configured to make 120 & CUPS; -PPD; s along its own compilation. & HP; Laser- and DeskJet, Epson Stylus and Photo Color models as well as some Canon and Lexmark are covered.
third, there is the commercial extension to & CUPS; from the & CUPS; developers themselves: it is called ESP PrintPro and comes with more than 2.300 printer drivers. There are even improved imagetoraster and pstoraster filters included.
& CUPS; makes it really easy for manufacturers to start supporting & Linux; and & UNIX; printing for their models at reasonably low cost. The modular framework of & CUPS; facilitates to plug in any filter (=driver) with minimal effort and to access and utilize the whole printing framework that & CUPS; is creating.
Read more about the exciting & CUPS; features in the available & CUPS; documentation at http: / /www. cups. org/ documentation. html and http: / /www. danka. de/ printpro/ faq. html. Also at http: / /www. linuxprinting. org/ is a universal repository for all issues related to & Linux; and & UNIX; printing.
How & IPP; Support Makes & CUPS; the Best Choice Around
LPD Must Die!
For a long time many developers were deeply dissatisfied with good old LPD. Quite a few new projects were started to improve printing: LPRng is the best known example. Others are PDQ, PPR, PLP, GNUlpr and RLPR. But none of the new programs were seen as a big shot; most of them are just implementing the same old LPD specification with a few (or many) new extensions, which again make them incompatible with each other.
Having seen the development of not just one, but different viable alternatives to venerable BSD -style LPD, Grant Taylor, author of the Linux Printing HOWTO, finally rallied the call LPD Must Die! in his Campaign To Abolish The Line Printer Daemon.
How the & IPP; Came to Be
Along with the above, on the industry side of things, there were efforts to overcome the well-known weaknesses of LPD. It started with proprietary extensions to plain old LPD, and stretched as far as & Hewlett-Packard; 's attempt to establish & HP; JetDirect as a new standard for a network printing protocol. The result were even more incompatibilities.
In the end, an initiative to define a new common industry and IETF standard took shape. The Printer Working Group or PWG, a loose aggregation of vendors in hardware, software, and operating systems, drafted the new Internet Printing Protocol, & IPP;. & IPP; v1.1 has now been approved by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) as a proposed standard, and now enjoys the unanimous support throughout the industry in Europe, USA and Japan. Most current network printer models have now built in & IPP; support on top of traditional LPR / LPD or JetDirect Printing.
Why & IPP; is Solving Many Problems
& IPP; promises to solve a lot of problems network administrators face. This trade normally deals with heterogeneous network environments and spends more than half of its working hours dealing with printing problems.
By creating a unified set of query functions for & IPP; enabled printers and servers, for transferring files and setting job-control attributes & etc;, & IPP; is destined to work across all & OS; platforms. Its rollout however, will not happen overnight, as many legacy print devices will still be in use for many years to come. Therefore, in & IPP; there is a provision made for backwards compatibility of all & IPP; implementations. & CUPS; is proving the viability of & IPP; printing in all environments.
The most striking advantage will be its integration into the existing set of other robust IP protocols. Being an extension of the proven and robust HTTP 1.1 protocol, for the special task of handling print file and related data, it is also very easy to plug in other standards as they are being developed and deployed:
Basic, Digest, and Certificate Authentication for users seeking access to print services.
SSL3 and TLS encryption for transferring data.
Bi directional communication of clients with print devices, using the HTTP / IPP; GET and POST mechanism.
LDAP directory service integration to keep a consistent database of available printers, their capabilities and page-costs, & etc;, as well as user passwords, ACL s & etc;.
Pull (as opposed to the usual Push model) printing, where a server or printer just needs to be told the & URL; of a document, whereupon it is retrieved from the resource on the internet and printed.
Printer Plug'n'Play for Clients
Have you ever seen a demonstration about & CUPS; capabilities in the network? You must have been quite impressed if you did n't know in advance what to expect.
Imagine you as the administrator of a LAN. For testing purposes you fully installed one & kde; /CUPS; box on your net, complete with a dozen printers configured and functional: & PostScript;, LaserJets, InkJets and BubbleJets, and so on. Your & kde; users on that box are very happy, they can print like never before, ringing all the bells and whistles of every printer. It took you 2 hours to make everything run perfectly... and now all the other 100 users on the network want the same. Two hours again for every box? No way you could do that before next year, you think?
Wrong. Just change one setting in the original & CUPS; box to make it a server. Install & CUPS; on five other boxes, as clients. By the time you turn back to your first client, you find the users happily playing with the settings for the dozen printers you had defined earlier on the server. Somehow magically the printers had appeared on all the Print dialogs of the five new & CUPS; client boxes.
Your users print, but not a single driver had been installed on the clients, nor a printer queue defined.
So, how does this magic work?
Seeing Printers Not Installed Locally?
The answer is not complicated at all.
If a & CUPS; server is on the LAN, it broadcasts the names of all available printers to the LAN, using the UDP protocol and port 631. Port 631 is reserved as a well-known port by IANA (the Internet Assigning Numbers Authority) for & IPP; purposes. All & CUPS; clients listen to & CUPS; server info sent to their port 631. That's how they know about available printers, and that's how they learn about the path to the printers as well.
Using & IPP;, which is really a clever extension to HTTP v1.1, & CUPS; is able to address all objects related to the printing system via Universal Resource Locators or URL s. Print jobs to be deleted or restarted, printers to be queried or modified, admin tasks to be performed on the server, with & IPP; and & CUPS;, everything is addressable by a certain URL. Many important things can be done through the web interface to & CUPS;, accessible for example with & konqueror;.
Printing Without Installing a Driver
And more, the clients basically can administer and use any printer they see, just as if it was a locally installed one. Of course, you can set restrictions on it with access control lists & etc;, so that not any clients may use any printer as it likes.
The clients even are able to print without the appropriate filter (or driver) installed locally.
So how does this work? If a client wants to know about and select printer-specific options, it sends a request (called CUPS-get-ppd) to the server. The server tells the client all about all printer-specific options, as read from the server side & PPD;. The user on the client side can see the options and select the required ones. He then sends the print file, usually unfiltered raw & PostScript;, spiced up with the printer-options to the printer server, using & IPP; as the transport protocol. All further processing, especially the filtering to generate the final format for the target printer, is then done by the server. The server has the necessary programs (drivers or filters) to do this.
This way a client prints without needing to install a driver locally.
Any change on the server, such as adding or modifying a printer, is instantly known to the clients with no further configuration.
Zero Administration, Load Balancing, and Failover Switching
Some other advanced features built into & CUPS; are the capacity to do load balancing.
If you define the same printer queues on two or more different servers, the clients will send their jobs to the first responding or available server. This implies an automatic load balancing amongst servers. If you have to take one server off the network for maintenance, the others will just take over its tasks without the users even noticing the difference.

Mount root filesystem & read-only
Mount the root filesystem for this kernel read-only. Since the init scripts normally take care of remounting the root filesystem in read-write mode after running some checks, this should always be turned on. Do not turn this off unless you know what you are doing.
Do not check & partition table
This turns off some sanity checks while writing the configuration. This should not be used under "normal" circumstances, but it can be useful, for example, by providing the capability of booting from a floppy disk, without having a floppy in the drive every time you run lilo. This sets the unsafe keyword in lilo. conf.
& Record boot command lines for defaults
Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the default for the following bootups. This way, lilo "locks" on a choice until it is manually overridden. This sets the lock option in lilo. conf
Restrict parameters
If this box is checked, a password (entered below) is required only if any parameters are changed (i. e. the user can boot linux, but not linux single or linux init=/ bin/ sh). This sets the restricted option in lilo. conf.
Require & password:
Enter the password required for bootup (if any) here. If restricted above is checked, the password is required for additional parameters only. WARNING: The password is stored in clear text in / etc/ lilo. conf. Make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file. Also, you probably do not want to use your normal/ root password here.

LILO Configuration
(c) 2000, Bernhard Rosenkraenzer
Bernhard "Bero" Rosenkraenzer
Select...
You can edit the lilo. conf file directly here. All changes you make here are automatically transferred to the graphical interface.
Install & boot record to drive/ partition:
Select the drive or partition you want to install the LILO boot loader to here. Unless you intend to use other boot managers in addition to LILO, this should be the MBR (master boot record) of your boot drive. In this case, you should probably select / dev/ hda if your boot drive is an IDE drive or / dev/ sda if your boot drive is SCSI.
Boot the default kernel/ OS & after:
/ 10 seconds
LILO will wait the amount of time specified here before booting the kernel (or OS) marked as default in the Images tab.
Use & linear mode
Check this box if you want to use the linear mode. Linear mode tells the boot loader the location of kernels in linear addressing rather than sector/ head/ cylinder. Linear mode is required for some SCSI drives, and should not cause problems unless you are planning to create a boot disk to be used with a different computer. See the lilo. conf man page for details.
Use & compact mode
Check this box if you want to use the compact mode. The compact mode tries to merge read requests for adjacent sectors into a single read request. This reduces load time and keeps the boot map smaller, but will not work on all systems.
Checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the defaults for the following boots. This way, lilo "locks" on a choice until it is manually overridden. This sets the lock option in lilo. conf.
If this box is checked, a password (entered below) is required only if any parameters are changed (i. e. the user can boot linux, but not linux single or linux init=/ bin/ sh). This sets the restricted option in lilo. conf. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
Enter the password required for bootup (if any) here. If restricted is checked above, the password is only required for additional parameters. WARNING: The password is stored in clear text in / etc/ lilo. conf. Make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file. Also, you probably do not want to use your normal/ root password here. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
& Default graphics mode on text console:
You can select the default graphics mode here. If you intend to use a VGA graphics mode, you must compile the kernel with support for framebuffer devices. The ask setting brings up a prompt at boot time. This sets a default for all Linux kernels you want to boot. If you need a per-kernel setting, go to the Operating systems tab and select Details.
Enter LILO & prompt automatically
If this box is checked, LILO goes to the LILO prompt whether or not a key is pressed. If it is turned off, LILO boots the default operating system unless shift is pressed (in that case, it goes to the LILO prompt). This sets the prompt option in lilo. conf.
This is the list of kernels and operating systems you can currently boot. Select which one you want to edit here.
& Kernel:
Enter the filename of the kernel you want to boot here.
& Label:
Enter the label (name) of the kernel you want to boot here.
& Root filesystem:
Enter the root filesystem (i. e. the partition that will be mounted as / at boot time) for the kernel you want to boot here.
& Initial ramdisk:
If you want to use an initial ramdisk (initrd) for this kernel, enter its filename here. Leave this field blank if you do not intend to use an initial ramdisk for this kernel.
Extra parameters:
Enter any extra parameters you wish to pass to the kernel here. Usually, this can be left blank. This sets the append option in lilo. conf.

This turns off some sanity checks while writing the configuration. This should not be used under "normal" circumstances, but it is useful, for example, for installing the possibility to boot from a floppy disk without having a floppy in the drive every time you run lilo. This sets the unsafe keyword in lilo. conf.

Unmount Tape
KDat will dump your files properly to tape, but may not be able to restore them. To restore your files by hand, you need to know the name of the *non-rewinding* version of your tape device %1.
For example, if your device is / dev/ st0, the non-rewinding version is / dev/ nst0. If your device name does not look like that, type "ls -l %1" in a terminal window to see the real name of your tape drive. Substitute that name for / dev/ nst0 below. Open a terminal window and type the following: tar tfv / dev/ nst0; tar tfv / dev/ nst0 tar xfv / dev/ nst0 The third call to "tar" will retrieve your data into your current directory. Please let us know if this happens to you. - KDat Maintenance Team

& Available Services
These are the services available on your computer. To start a service, drag it onto the Start section of a runlevel. To stop one, do the same for the Stop section.
You can drag services from a runlevel onto the trashcan to delete them from that runlevel. The Undo command can be used to restore deleted entries.
Runlevel & %1
Runlevel %1
These are the services started in runlevel %1. The number shown on the left of the icon determines the order in which the services are started. You can arrange them via drag and drop, as long as a suitable sorting number can be generated. If that's not possible, you have to change the number manually via the Properties dialog box.

Stop
These are the services stopped in runlevel %1. The number shown on the left of the icon determines the order in which the services are stopped. You can arrange them via drag and drop, as long as a suitable sorting number can be generated. If that's not possible, you have to change the number manually via the Properties dialog box.

You have specified that your system's init scripts are located in the folder %1, but this folder does not exist. You probably selected the wrong distribution during configuration. If you reconfigure %2, it may be possible to fix the problem. If you choose to reconfigure, you should shut down the application and the configuration wizard will appear the next time %3 is run. If you choose not to reconfigure, you will not be able to view or edit your system's init configuration. Would you like to reconfigure %4?
Folder Does Not Exist
You do not have the right permissions to edit your system's init configuration. However, you are free to browse the runlevels. If you really want to edit the configuration, either restart %1 as root (or another privileged user), or ask your sysadmin to install %2 suid or sgid. The latter way is not recommended though, due to security issues.

Uses a simple simple motion model to generate many different display modes. The control points attract each other up to a certain distance, and then begin to repel each other.

Fuzzy rotation speed
Repeatedly rotates a bitmap by 90 degrees by using logical operations: the bitmap is divided into quadrants, and the quadrants are shifted clockwise. Then the same thing is done again with progressively smaller quadrants, except that all sub-quadrants of a given size are rotated in parallel. As you watch it, the image appears to dissolve into static and then reconstitute itself, but rotated. Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1992.

To make it easier to visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of each face. Do n't think about it too long, or your brain will melt.

Penrose said he does n't like litigation but, "When it comes to the population of Great Britain being invited by a multinational to wipe their bottoms on what appears to be the work of a Knight of the Realm, then a last stand must be taken."

This makes collages out of random images pulled off of the World Wide Web. It finds these images by doing random web searches, and then extracting images from the returned pages.

Please act accordingly. See also http: / /www. jwz. org/ webcollage/ Written by Jamie Zawinski; 1999.

After pressing Ctrl+Alt+I, the KSIRC window will be activated, if it exists. Simple.

KSIRC
After pressing Alt+Ctrl+H the input of'Hello 'will be simulated, as if you typed it. This is especially useful if you have call to frequently type a word (for instance, 'unsigned'). Every keypress in the input is separated by a colon ':'. Note that the keypresses literally mean keypresses, so you have to write what you would press on the keyboard. In the table below, the left column shows the input and the right column shows what to type.\\ "enter" (i. e. new line) Enter or Return\ a (i. e. small a) A\ A (i. e. capital a) Shift+A\: (colon) Shift+;\ '' (space) Space
Type'Hello '
This action runs Konsole, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
Run Konsole
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Qt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows. In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in QT Designer. Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\\ This problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\\ We now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt Designer.\ Qt Designer seems to always have title'Qt Designer by Trolltech ', so the condition will check for the active window having that title.
Remap Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 in Qt Designer
By pressing Alt+Ctrl+W a D-Bus call will be performed that will show the minicli. You can use any kind of D-Bus call, just like using the command line'qdbus' tool.
Perform D-Bus call'kdesktop KDesktopIface popupExecuteCommand() '
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Just like the "Type'Hello'" action, this one simulates keyboard input, specifically, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+B, it sends B to XMMS (B in XMMS jumps to the next song). The'Send to specific window 'checkbox is checked and a window with its class containing'XMMS_Player' is specified; this will make the input always be sent to this window. This way, you can control XMMS even if, for instance, it is on a different virtual desktop.\\ (Run'xprop 'and click on the XMMS window and search for WM_CLASS to see'XMMS_Player').
Next in XMMS

Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\ Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\ Right now, there are the following gestures available:\ move right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\ move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\ move up and back down - Up (Alt+Up)\ circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\\ The gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\ Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once. For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\\ The conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains'konqueror ').

About Bug Reporting - Help
Information about bug reporting
You can help us improve this software by filing a bug report.
It is safe to close this dialog. If you do not want to, you do not have to file a bug report.
In order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system. (You may also need to install some debug packages.)
Bug Reporting Assistant Guide
This assistant will guide you through the crash reporting process for the KDE Bug Reports Database Site. All the information you enter on the bug report must be in English, if possible, as KDE is formed internationally.
What do you know about the crash?
In this page you need to describe how much do you know about the desktop and the application state before it crashed.
If you can, describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances, and what you were doing when the application crashed (this information is going to be requested later.) You can mention:
actions you were taking inside or outside the application
documents or images that you were using and their type/ format (later if you go to look at the report in the bug tracking system, you can attach a file to the report)
widgets that you were running
the URL of a web site you were browsing
configuration details of the application
or other strange things you notice before or after the crash.
Screenshots can be very helpful sometimes. You can attach them to the bug report after it is posted to the bug tracking system.
Crash Information (backtrace)
This page will generate a "backtrace" of the crash. This is information that tells the developers where the application crashed.
If the crash information is not detailed enough, you may need to install some debug packages and reload it (if the Install Debug Symbols button is available you can use it to automatically install the missing information.)
You can find more information about backtraces, what they mean, and how they are useful at %1
Once you get a useful backtrace (or if you do not want to install the missing debugging packages) you can continue.
Conclusions
Using the quality of the crash information gathered, and your answers on the previous page, the assistant will tell you if the crash is worth reporting or not.
If the crash is worth reporting but the application is not supported in the KDE bug tracking system, you will need to directly contact the maintainer of the application.
If the crash is listed as being not worth reporting, and you think the assistant has made a mistake, you can still manually report the bug by logging into the bug tracking system. You can also go back and change information and download debug packages.
Login into the bug tracking system
We may need to contact you in the future to ask for further information. As we need to keep track of the bug reports, you need to have an account on the KDE bug tracking system. If you do not have one, you can create one here: %1
Then, enter your username and password and press the Login button. You can use this login to directly access the KDE bug tracking system later.
The KWallet dialog may appear when pressing Login to save your password in the KWallet password system. Also, it will prompt you for the KWallet password upon loading to autocomplete the login fields if you use this assistant again.
List of possible duplicate reports
This page will search the bug report database for similar crashes which are possible duplicates of your bug. If there are similar bug reports found, you can double click on them to see details. Then, read the current bug report information so you can check to see if they are similar.
If you are very sure your bug is the same as another that is previously reported, you can set your information to be attached to the existing report.
If you are unsure whether your report is the same, follow the main options to tentatively mark your crash as a duplicate of that report. This is usually the safest thing to do. We cannot uncombine bug reports, but we can easily merge them.
If not enough possible duplicates are found, or you did not find a similar report, then you can force it to search for more bug reports (only if the date range limit is not reached.)
If you do not find any related reports, your crash information is not useful enough, and you really cannot give additional information about the crash context, then it is better to not file the bug report, thereby closing the assistant.
Details of the bug report and your system
In this case you need to write a title and description of the crash. Explain as best you can.
You can also specify your distribution method (GNU/ Linux distribution or packaging system) or if you compiled the KDE Platform from sources.
You should write in English.
Sending the Crash Report
The last page will send the bug report to the bug tracking system and will notify you when it is done. It will then show the web address of the bug report in the KDE bug tracking system, so that you can look at the report later.
If the process fails, you can click Retry to try sending the bug report again. If the report cannot be sent because the bug tracking database has a problem, you can save it to a file to manually report later.
Thank you for being part of KDE!

Here you can configure what the Konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file of this type. Konqueror can either display the file in an embedded viewer, or start up a separate application. If set to'Use settings for G group ', the file manager will behave according to the settings of the group G to which this type belongs; for instance, 'image' if the current file type is image/ png. Dolphin always shows files in a separate viewer.

File Associations This module allows you to choose which applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also referred to as MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"). A file association consists of the following: Rules for determining the MIME-type of a file, for example the filename pattern *. png, which means'all files with names that end in. png ', is associated with the MIME type "image/ png"; A short description of the MIME-type, for example the description of the MIME type "image/ png" is simply'PNG image'; An icon to be used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily identify the type of file in a file manager or file-selection dialog (at least for the types you use often); A list of the applications which can be used to open files of the given MIME-type -- if more than one application can be used then the list is ordered by priority. You may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated filename patterns; in these cases, KDE is able to determine the MIME-type by directly examining the contents of the file.
Find file type or filename pattern
Enter a part of a filename pattern, and only file types with a matching file pattern will appear in the list. Alternatively, enter a part of a file type name as it appears in the list.
Known Types
Here you can see a hierarchical list of the file types which are known on your system. Click on the '+ 'sign to expand a category, or the '-' sign to collapse it. Select a file type (e. g. text/ html for HTML files) to view/ edit the information for that file type using the controls on the right.

Use customized bell
If this option is checked, the default system bell will be used. See the "System Bell" control module for how to customize the system bell. Normally, this is just a "beep".
Check this option if you want to use a customized bell, playing a sound file. If you do this, you will probably want to turn off the system bell. Please note that on slow machines this may cause a "lag" between the event causing the bell and the sound being played.
Sound & to play:
If the option "Use customized bell" is enabled, you can choose a sound file here. Click "Browse..." to choose a sound file using the file dialog.
Visible Bell
& Use visible bell
This option will turn on the "visible bell", i. e. a visible notification shown every time that normally just a bell would occur. This is especially useful for deaf people.

Colors This module allows you to choose the color scheme used for the KDE desktop. The different elements of the desktop, such as title bars, menu text, etc., are called "widgets". You can choose the widget whose color you want to change by selecting it from a list, or by clicking on a graphical representation of the desktop. You can save color settings as complete color schemes, which can also be modified or deleted. KDE comes with several predefined color schemes on which you can base your own. All KDE applications will obey the selected color scheme. Non-KDE applications may also obey some or all of the color settings, if this option is enabled.
This is a preview of the color settings which will be applied if you click "Apply" or "OK". You can click on different parts of this preview image. The widget name in the "Widget color" box will change to reflect the part of the preview image you clicked.
This is a list of predefined color schemes, including any that you may have created. You can preview an existing color scheme by selecting it from the list. The current scheme will be replaced by the selected color scheme. Warning: if you have not yet applied any changes you may have made to the current scheme, those changes will be lost if you select another color scheme.
Press this button if you want to save the current color settings as a color scheme. You will be prompted for a name.
Press this button to remove the selected color scheme. Note that this button is disabled if you do not have permission to delete the color scheme.
Press this button to import a new color scheme. Note that the color scheme will only be available for the current user.

This graph gives you an overview of the total sum of physical and virtual memory in your system.
Physical Memory
This graph gives you an overview of the usage of physical memory in your system. Most operating systems (including Linux) will use as much of the available physical memory as possible as disk cache, to speed up the system performance. This means that if you have a small amount of Free Physical Memory and a large amount of Disk Cache Memory, your system is well configured.
Swap Space
The swap space is the virtual memory available to the system. It will be used on demand and is provided through one or more swap partitions and/ or swap files.

Mouse This module allows you to choose various options for the way in which your pointing device works. Your pointing device may be a mouse, trackball, or some other hardware that performs a similar function.
& General
If you are left-handed, you may prefer to swap the functions of the left and right buttons on your pointing device by choosing the'left-handed 'option. If your pointing device has more than two buttons, only those that function as the left and right buttons are affected. For example, if you have a three-button mouse, the middle button is unaffected.
The default behavior in KDE is to select and activate icons with a single click of the left button on your pointing device. This behavior is consistent with what you would expect when you click links in most web browsers. If you would prefer to select with a single click, and activate with a double click, check this option.
Activates and opens a file or folder with a single click.
If you check this option, pausing the mouse pointer over an icon on the screen will automatically select that icon. This may be useful when single clicks activate icons, and you want only to select the icon without activating it.
If you have checked the option to automatically select icons, this slider allows you to select how long the mouse pointer must be paused over the icon before it is selected.
Advanced
Pointer acceleration:
This option allows you to change the relationship between the distance that the mouse pointer moves on the screen and the relative movement of the physical device itself (which may be a mouse, trackball, or some other pointing device.) A high value for the acceleration will lead to large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small movement with the physical device. Selecting very high values may result in the mouse pointer flying across the screen, making it hard to control.
Pointer threshold:
The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move on the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement is smaller than the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set to 1X; thus, when you make small movements with the physical device, there is no acceleration at all, giving you a greater degree of control over the mouse pointer. With larger movements of the physical device, you can move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.
msec
Double click interval:
The double click interval is the maximal time (in milliseconds) between two mouse clicks which turns them into a double click. If the second click happens later than this time interval after the first click, they are recognized as two separate clicks.
Drag start time:
If you click with the mouse (e. g. in a multi-line editor) and begin to move the mouse within the drag start time, a drag operation will be initiated.
Drag start distance:
If you click with the mouse and begin to move the mouse at least the drag start distance, a drag operation will be initiated.
Mouse wheel scrolls by:
If you use the wheel of a mouse, this value determines the number of lines to scroll for each wheel movement. Note that if this number exceeds the number of visible lines, it will be ignored and the wheel movement will be handled as a page up/ down movement.

Service Manager This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of service: Services invoked at startup Services called on demand The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. In Administrator mode, you can also define whether services should be loaded at startup. Use this with care: some services are vital for KDE; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.

Cache This module lets you configure your cache settings. The cache is an internal memory in Konqueror where recently read web pages are stored. If you want to retrieve a web page again that you have recently read, it will not be downloaded from the Internet, but rather retrieved from the cache, which is a lot faster.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or other KDE applications using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer, initiated by a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie, allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that you trust, you might want to set the policy to accept, then you can access the web sites without being prompted every time KDE receives a cookie.

Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. You might, for example want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie or simply reject or accept everything. For example, you might choose to accept all cookies from your favorite shopping web site. For this all you have to do is either browse to that particular site and when you are presented with the cookie dialog box, click on This domain under the'apply to' tab and choose accept or simply specify the name of the site in the Domain Specific Policy tab and set it to accept. This enables you to receive cookies from trusted web sites without being asked every time KDE receives a cookie.

Proxy A proxy server is an intermediate program that sits between your machine and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching and/ or filtering. Caching proxy servers give you faster access to sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching the content of those pages; filtering proxy servers, on the other hand, provide the ability to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block. Note: Some proxy servers provide both services.

Reject the so called third-party cookies. These are cookies that originate from a site other than the one you are currently browsing. For example, if you visit www. foobar. com while this option is on, only cookies that originate from www. foobar. com will be processed per your settings. Cookies from any other site will be rejected. This reduces the chances of site operators compiling a profile about your daily browsing habits.
Only accept cookies from originating server
Automatically accept temporary cookies meant to expire at the end of the current session. Such cookies will not be stored in your computer's hard drive or storage device. Instead, they are deleted when you close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. NOTE: Checking this option along with the next one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.
Automatically accept session cookies
Treat all cookies as session cookies. Session cookies are small pieces of data that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory until you quit or close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. Unlike regular cookies, session cookies are never stored on your hard drive or other storage medium. NOTE: Checking this option along with the previous one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.
Treat & all cookies as session cookies
Determines how cookies received from a remote machine will be handled: Ask will cause KDE to ask for your confirmation whenever a server wants to set a cookie.

Windows Shares Konqueror is able to access shared Microsoft Windows file systems, if properly configured. If there is a specific computer from which you want to browse, fill in the Browse server field. This is mandatory if you are not running Samba locally. The Broadcast address and WINS address fields will also be available, if you use the native code, or the location of the'smb. conf 'file from which the options are read, when using Samba. In any case, the broadcast address (interfaces in smb. conf) must be set up if it is guessed incorrectly or you have multiple cards. A WINS server usually improves performance, and reduces the network load a lot. The bindings are used to assign a default user for a given server, possibly with the corresponding password, or for accessing specific shares. If you choose to, new bindings will be created for logins and shares accessed during browsing. You can edit all of them from here. Passwords will be stored locally, and scrambled so as to render them unreadable to the human eye. For security reasons, you may not want to do that, as entries with passwords are clearly indicated as such.

Browser Identification The browser-identification module allows you to have full control over how Konqueror will identify itself to web sites you browse. This ability to fake identification is necessary because some web sites do not display properly when they detect that they are not talking to current versions of either Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, even if the browser actually supports all the necessary features to render those pages properly. For such sites, you can use this feature to try to browse them. Please understand that this might not always work, since such sites might be using non-standard web protocols and or specifications. NOTE: To obtain specific help on a particular section of the dialog box, simply click on the quick help button on the window title bar, then click on the section for which you are seeking help.
Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker.

Preview Options Here you can modify the behavior of Konqueror when it shows the files in a folder. The list of protocols: check the protocols over which previews should be shown; uncheck those over which they should not. For instance, you might want to show previews over SMB if the local network is fast enough, but you might disable it for FTP if you often visit very slow FTP sites with large images. Maximum File Size: select the maximum file size for which previews should be generated. For instance, if set to 1 MB (the default), no preview will be generated for files bigger than 1 MB, for speed reasons.

If this box is checked, Konqueror will automatically load any images that are embedded in a web page. Otherwise, it will display placeholders for the images, and you can then manually load the images by clicking on the image button. Unless you have a very slow network connection, you will probably want to check this box to enhance your browsing experience.
If this box is checked, Konqueror will draw a frame as a placeholder around images embedded in a web page that are not yet fully loaded. You will probably want to check this box to enhance your browsing experience, especially if have a slow network connection.

To change an existing policy, click on the Change... button and choose the new policy from the policy dialog box. Clicking on the Delete button will remove the selected policy, causing the default policy setting to be used for that domain.
Enabling the security manager will cause the jvm to run with a Security Manager in place. This will keep applets from being able to read and write to your file system, creating arbitrary sockets, and other actions which could be used to compromise your system. Disable this option at your own risk. You can modify your $HOME/. java. policy file with the Java policytool utility to give code downloaded from certain sites more permissions.
Enter the path to the java executable. If you want to use the jre in your path, simply leave it as'java '. If you need to use a different jre, enter the path to the java executable (e. g. / usr/ lib/ jdk/ bin/ java), or the path to the directory that contains'bin/ java' (e. g. / opt/ IBMJava2-13).
If you want special arguments to be passed to the virtual machine, enter them here.
When all the applets have been destroyed, the applet server should shut down. However, starting the jvm takes a lot of time. If you would like to keep the java process running while you are browsing, you can set the timeout value to whatever you like. To keep the java process running for the whole time that the konqueror process is, leave the Shutdown Applet Server checkbox unchecked.

Konqueror Stylesheets This module allows you to apply your own color and font settings to Konqueror by using stylesheets (CSS). You can either specify options or apply your own self-written stylesheet by pointing to its location. Note that these settings will always have precedence before all other settings made by the site author. This can be useful to visually impaired people or for web pages that are unreadable due to bad design.
Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 User defined stylesheets allow increased accessibility for visually handicapped people.
Expression (e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ad/ *):
Enter an expression to filter. Expressions can be defined as either a filename style wildcard e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ads* or as a full regular expression by surrounding the string with '/ 'e. g. / /(ad_BAR_banner)\\. /

Enhanced Browsing In this module you can configure some enhanced browsing features of KDE. Web Shortcuts Web Shortcuts are a quick way of using Web search engines. For example, type "altavista: frobozz" or "av: frobozz" and Konqueror will do a search on AltaVista for "frobozz". Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

Search & URI:
Enter the URI that is used to do a search on the search engine here. The whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\{@} or \\{0}. Recommended is \\{@}, since it removes all query variables (name=value) from the resulting string whereas \\{0} will be substituted with the unmodified query string. You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{name} to specify a value given by'name=value 'in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as substitution value for the resulting URI. A quoted string can be used as default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.
Search & provider name:
The shortcuts entered here can be used as a pseudo-URI scheme in KDE. For example, the shortcut av can be used as in av: my search

& Policy:
The focus policy is used to determine the active window, i. e. the window you can work in. Click to focus: A window becomes active when you click into it. This is the behavior you might know from other operating systems. Focus follows mouse: Moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it. New windows will receive the focus, without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. Very practical if you are using the mouse a lot. Focus under mouse: The window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, the last window that was under the mouse has focus. New windows will not automatically receive the focus. Focus strictly under mouse: Only the window under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has focus. Note that'Focus under mouse 'and'Focus strictly under mouse' prevent certain features such as the Alt+Tab walk through windows dialog in the KDE mode from working properly.

Delay focus by:
Click raises active window
When this option is enabled, a window in the background will automatically come to the front when the mouse pointer has been over it for some time.
This is the delay after which the window that the mouse pointer is over will automatically come to the front.
When this option is enabled, the active window will be brought to the front when you click somewhere into the window contents. To change it for inactive windows, you need to change the settings in the Actions tab.
When this option is enabled, there will be a delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will become active (receive focus).
This is the delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will automatically receive focus.

Here you can define the thousands separator used to display numbers. Note that the thousands separator used to display monetary values has to be set separately (see the'Money 'tab).
Here you can specify text used to prefix positive numbers. Most people leave this blank.
Here you can specify text used to prefix negative numbers. This should not be empty, so you can distinguish positive and negative numbers. It is normally set to minus (-).
Here you can set the number of decimal places displayed for numeric values, i. e. the number of digits after the decimal separator.
Here you can define the set of digits used to display numbers. If digits other than Arabic are selected, they will appear only if used in the language of the application or the piece of text where the number is shown. Note that the set of digits used to display monetary values has to be set separately (see the'Money 'tab).

System Notifications KDE allows for a great deal of control over how you will be notified when certain events occur. There are several choices as to how you are notified: As the application was originally designed. With a beep or other noise. Via a popup dialog box with additional information. By recording the event in a logfile without any additional visual or audible alert.

& Statistics
The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs smbstatus and showmount. Smbstatus reports on current Samba connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements the SMB (Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or LanManager protocol. This protocol can be used to provide printer sharing or drive sharing services on a network including machines running the various flavors of Microsoft Windows.

Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.

Unable to contact the KDE smartcard service.
Possible Reasons
1) The KDE daemon, 'kded 'is not running. You can restart it by running the command'kdeinit' and then try reloading the KDE System Settings to see if this message goes away. 2) You do not appear to have smartcard support in the KDE libraries. You will need to recompile the kdelibs package with libpcsclite installed.
Smartcard Support
& Enable smartcard support
Enable & polling to autodetect card events
In most cases you should have this enabled. It allows KDE to automatically detect card insertion and reader hotplug events.
Automatically & launch card manager if inserted card is unclaimed
When you insert a smartcard, KDE can automatically launch a management tool if no other application attempts to use the card.

Here you can choose from a list of predefined widget styles (e. g. the way buttons are drawn) which may or may not be combined with a theme (additional information like a marble texture or a gradient).
This area shows a preview of the currently selected style without having to apply it to the whole desktop.
No Text: Shows only icons on toolbar buttons. Best option for low resolutions. Text Only: Shows only text on toolbar buttons. Text Beside Icons: Shows icons and text on toolbar buttons. Text is aligned beside the icon. Text Below Icons: Shows icons and text on toolbar buttons. Text is aligned below the icon.
If you enable this option, KDE Applications will show small icons alongside some important buttons.
If you enable this option, KDE Applications will run internal animations.

Selected style: %1 One or more effects that you have chosen could not be applied because the selected style does not support them; they have therefore been disabled.
Menu translucency is not available.
Menu drop-shadows are not available.
If you check this box, you can select several effects for different widgets like combo boxes, menus or tooltips.
Disable: do not use any combo box effects. Animate: Do some animation.
Disable: do not use any tooltip effects. Animate: Do some animation. Fade: Fade in tooltips using alpha-blending.
Disable: do not use any menu effects. Animate: Do some animation. Fade: Fade in menus using alpha-blending. Make Translucent: Alpha-blend menus for a see-through effect. (KDE styles only)
When enabled, all popup menus will have a drop-shadow, otherwise drop-shadows will not be displayed. At present, only KDE styles can have this effect enabled.
Software Tint: Alpha-blend using a flat color. Software Blend: Alpha-blend using an image. XRender Blend: Use the XFree RENDER extension for image blending (if available). This method may be slower than the Software routines on non-accelerated displays, but may however improve performance on remote displays.
By adjusting this slider you can control the menu effect opacity.
Note: that all widgets in this combobox do not apply to Qt-only applications.
If you check this box, the toolbars will be transparent when moving them around.
If you enable this option some pop-up menus will show so called tear-off handles. If you click them, you get the menu inside a widget. This can be very helpful when performing the same action multiple times.

Enable background
If this is checked, KDM will use the settings below for the background. If it is disabled, you have to look after the background yourself. This is done by running some program (possibly xsetroot) in the script specified in the Setup= option in kdmrc (usually Xsetup).

Preselect the user that logged in previously. Use this if this computer is usually used several consecutive times by one user.
Specified:
Preselect the user specified in the combo box to the right. Use this if this computer is predominantly used by a certain user.
Select the user to be preselected for login. This box is editable, so you can specify an arbitrary non-existent user to mislead possible attackers.
Focus password
When this option is on, KDM will place the cursor in the password field instead of the user field after preselecting a user. Use this to save one key press per login, if the preselection usually does not need to be changed.
Enable Password-Less Logins
When this option is checked, the checked users from the list below will be allowed to log in without entering their password. This applies only to KDM's graphical login. Think twice before enabling this!
No password required for:
Check all users you want to allow a password-less login for. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Automatically log in again after & X server crash
When this option is on, a user will be logged in again automatically when their session is interrupted by an X server crash; note that this can open a security hole: if you use a screen locker than KDE's integrated one, this will make circumventing a password-secured screen lock possible.

KDE Login Manager Config Module
(c) 1996-2008 The KDM Authors
Original author
Current maintainer
Login Manager In this module you can configure the various aspects of the KDE Login Manager. This includes the look and feel as well as the users that can be selected for login. Note that you can only make changes if you run the module with superuser rights. If you have not started the KDE System Settings with superuser rights (which is absolutely the right thing to do, by the way), click on the Modify button to acquire superuser rights. You will be asked for the superuser password. General On this tab page, you can configure parts of the Login Manager's look, and which language it should use. The language settings made here have no influence on the user's language settings. Dialog Here you can configure the look of the "classical" dialog based mode if you have chosen to use it. Background If you want to set a special background for the dialog based login screen, this is where to do it. Themes Here you can specify a theme to be used by the Login Manager. Shutdown Here you can specify who is allowed to shutdown/ reboot the machine and whether a boot manager should be used. Users On this tab page, you can select which users the Login Manager will offer you for logging in. Convenience Here you can specify a user to be logged in automatically, users not needing to provide a password to log in, and other convenience features. Note, that these settings are security holes by their nature, so use them very carefully.

Separate clipboard and selection
This option prevents the selection being recorded in the clipboard history. Only explicit clipboard changes are recorded.
There are two different clipboard buffers available: Clipboard is filled by selecting something and pressing Ctrl+C, or by clicking "Copy" in a toolbar or menubar. Selection is available immediately after selecting some text. The only way to access the selection is to press the middle mouse button. You can configure the relationship between Clipboard and Selection.

Next: An Introduction to Konqueror
Konqueror is also a full featured and easy to use web browser which you can use to explore the Internet. Enter the address (e. g. http: / /www. kde. org) of a web page you would like to visit in the location bar and press Enter, or choose an entry from the Bookmarks menu.
To return to the previous location, press the back button in the toolbar.
To quickly go to your Home folder press the home button.
For more detailed documentation on Konqueror click here.
Tuning Tip: If you want the Konqueror web browser to start faster, you can turn off this information screen by clicking here. You can re-enable it by choosing the Help - > Konqueror Introduction menu option, and then pressing Settings - > Save View Profile As... - > "Web Browsing".
Konqueror is designed to embrace and support Internet standards. The aim is to fully implement the officially sanctioned standards from organizations such as the W3 and OASIS, while also adding extra support for other common usability features that arise as de facto standards across the Internet. Along with this support, for such functions as favicons, Web Shortcuts, and XBEL bookmarks, Konqueror also implements:

Use Web-Shortcuts: by typing "gg: KDE" one can search the Internet, using Google, for the search phrase "KDE". There are a lot of Web-Shortcuts predefined to make searching for software or looking up certain words in an encyclopedia a breeze. You can even create your own Web-Shortcuts.
Use the magnifier button in the toolbar to increase the font size on your web page.
You can also find "Full-Screen Mode" in the Settings menu. This feature is very useful for "Talk" sessions.
Divide et impera (lat. "Divide and conquer") - by splitting a window into two parts (e. g. Window - > Split View Left/ Right) you can make Konqueror appear the way you like. You can even load some example view-profiles (e. g. Midnight Commander), or create your own ones.
Use the user-agent feature if the website you are visiting asks you to use a different browser (and do not forget to send a complaint to the webmaster!)
The History in your SideBar ensures that you can keep track of the pages you have visited recently.
Use a caching proxy to speed up your Internet connection.
Advanced users will appreciate the Konsole which you can embed into Konqueror (Settings - > Show Terminal Emulator).

Disable keyboard layouts
Keyboard Layout Here you can choose your keyboard layout and model. The'model 'refers to the type of keyboard that is connected to your computer, while the keyboard layout defines "which key does what" and may be different for different countries.
Keyboard & model:
Here you can choose a keyboard model. This setting is independent of your keyboard layout and refers to the "hardware" model, i. e. the way your keyboard is manufactured. Modern keyboards that come with your computer usually have two extra keys and are referred to as "104-key" models, which is probably what you want if you do not know what kind of keyboard you have.
Available layouts:
Active layouts:
Layout variant:
Here you can choose a variant of selected keyboard layout. Layout variants usually represent different key maps for the same language. For example, Ukrainian layout might have four variants: basic, winkeys (as in Windows), typewriter (as in typewriters) and phonetic (each Ukrainian letter is placed on a transliterated latin one).

Here you can set xkb extension options instead of, or in addition to, specifying them in the X11 configuration file.

< < Remove
This is the command which is executed when switching to the selected layout. It may help you if you want to debug layout switching, or if you want to switch layouts without the help of KDE.
Sticky Switching
If you have more than two layouts and turn this option on, switching with the keyboard shortcut or clicking on the kxkb indicator will only cycle through the last few layouts. You can specify the number of layouts to rotate below. You can still access all layouts by right-clicking on the kxkb indicator.

Layout name
Options
If more than one layout is present in this list, the KDE panel will offer a docked flag. By clicking on this flag you can easily switch between layouts. The first layout will be default one.
Keymap
This is the list of available keyboard layouts in your system. You can add a layout to the active list by selecting it and pressing "Add" button.
If you check this option, pressing and holding down a key emits the same character over and over again. For example, pressing and holding down the Tab key will have the same effect as that of pressing that key several times in succession: Tab characters continue to be emitted until you release the key.
& Enable keyboard repeat
& Delay:
If supported, this option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes. The'Repeat rate 'option controls the frequency of these keycodes.
& Rate:
If supported, this option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed.
If supported, this option allows you to setup the state of NumLock after KDE startup. You can configure NumLock to be turned on or off, or configure KDE not to set NumLock state.
NumLock on KDE Startup

Leave unchanged
Turn on
If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. This might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys, or if the sound that the keys make is very soft. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin box. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.

The equation solver allows you to balance a chemical equation. Using VariablesTo express variable quantities of an element, put a single character in front of the element's symbol, as shown in this example: aH + bO - > 5H2O (Result: 10 H + 5 O -gt; 5 H2O)Solving this expression will give you the needed amount of Hydrogen and Oxygen. Defining electric chargesUse box brackets to specify the electric charge of an element, as shown in this example:4H[+] + 2O - > cH2O[2+] (Result: 4 H+ + 2 O -gt; 2 H2O2+)

\t\t You can locate objects in the sky by their name. \t\t\tUse Ctrl+F, the "Pointing- > Find Object" menu item, or the "Find Object" \t\t\tToolbar button. \t\t \t
\t\t To change your Geographic Location, \t\t\tuse Ctrl+G, the "Settings- > Geographic..." menu item, \t\t\tor the "globe" Toolbar button. \t\t \t
\t\t You can Track an object, so it will always be centered \t\t\tin the display. \t\t\tUse Ctrl+T, the "Pointing- > Engage Tracking" menu item, or the "lock" \t\t\tToolbar button. You can also simply center the object by \t\t\tdouble-clicking on it or selecting "Center and Track" from the \t\t\tobject's popup menu. \t\t \t
\t\t The KStars Handbook includes the AstroInfo Project, a series \t\t\tof informative articles about Astronomy. \t\t \t
\t\t There are three on-screen "Info Boxes" which show data related to the \t\t\ttime/ date, your geographic location, and the current central position on the \t\t\tsky (the focus). You can drag these boxes with the mouse, and "shade" them \t\t\tby double-clicking them to show more (or less) information. You can hide \t\t\tthem altogether in the Settings- > Info Boxes menu. \t\t \t
\t\t The N, S, E, W keys will point the display at the North, \t\t\tSouth, East and West points on the Horizon. The Z key will point the \t\t\tdisplay at the Zenith. \t\t \t
\t\t Click and Drag with the mouse to slew the skymap to a new position on \t\t\tthe sky. \t\t \t
\t\t Double-click with the mouse to center the display on the location \t\t\tof the mouse cursor. If you double-click on an object, KStars will \t\t\tautomatically begin tracking it. \t\t \t
\t\t The status bar displays the current sky coordinates of the mouse cursor, \t\t\tin both Equatorial and Horizontal coordinate systems. \t\t \t
\t\t You can manually set the coordinates of the central Focus point. \t\t\tPress Ctrl+M, or use the "Pointing- > Set Focus Manually..." menu item, and enter \t\t\tthe desired coordinates in the popup window. \t\t \t
\t\t To switch between Equatorial and Horizontal coordinate \t\t\tsystems, use the "View- > Coordinates" menu item, or press the spacebar. \t\t \t
\t\t To set the Time and Date, type Ctrl+S, use the "Time- > Set Time" menu item, \t\t\tor press the "time" toolbar button. Note that dates in KStars can be very \t\t\tremote; you can use any year between -50,000 and +50,000. \t\t \t
\t\t You can use Ctrl+E or the "Time- > Set Time to Now" menu item to synchronize \t\t\tthe simulation clock with your CPU clock. \t\t \t
\t\t The Spin Box in the Toolbar allows you to adjust the time step \t\t\tused by the KStars clock; setting it to "1.0 sec" provides "real time". \t\t\tNote: negative values make time run backwards. \t\t \t
\t\t You can stop and start the clock with the "Play/ Pause" button \t\t\tin the Toolbar, or with the "Time- > Stop Clock" menu item. \t\t \t
\t\t When you click your mouse in the map, the object in the sky nearest \t\t\tthe mouse cursor is identified in the status bar. \t\t \t
\t\t Right-click with the mouse to open a popup menu of detailed options \t\t\tfor a particular object, including links to images and information on \t\t\tthe Internet. \t\t \t
\t\t The deep-sky objects with a special color (the default is Red) \t\t\thave extra URL links available in their popup menu. \t\t \t
\t\t By default, stars in KStars are displayed with realistic colors. \t\t\tA star's color depends on its temperature; cooler stars are red, \t\t\twhile hotter stars are blue. \t\t \t
\t\t To add your own custom Object Catalogs, select "Import Catalog" or \t\t\t"Load Catalog "from the Catalogs tab in the KStars Configuration window. \t\t\tSee the Handbook for instructions on formatting your catalog file. \t\t \t
\t\t To add your own custom image/ information URLs to \t\t\tany object, select "Add Link..." from the object's popup menu. \t\t \t
\t\t You can adjust dozens of display options by clicking the \t\t\t"configure "Toolbar button, or selecting the" Settings- > Configure KStars... "\t\t\tmenu item. \t\t \t
\t\t The on-screen Info Boxes can be hidden or shown using the \t\t\t"Settings- > Info Boxes "menu. \t\t \t
\t\t The Toolbars can be hidden or shown using the "Settings- > Toolbars" menu. \t\t \t
\t\t You can easily switch between predefined color schemes by selecting \t\t\tthe scheme from the "Settings- > Color Schemes" menu. \t\t \t
\t\t You can define your own Geographic Locations. Fill in the \t\t\trequired fields in the "Set Geographic Location" Dialog and then press the \t\t\t"Add City to List "button. Your Locations will be available in all \t\t\tfuture sessions. \t\t \t
\t\t You can define your own Color Schemes. Adjust the colors \t\t\tin the Configuration Window's "Colors" Tab, and then press the "Save \t\t\tCurrent Colors" button. Your Color Scheme will appear in the list in \t\t\tall future sessions. \t\t \t
\t\t The Advanced tab of the KStars Configuration window allows you to fine-tune \t\t\tthe behavior of KStars. You can specify whether to correct for atmospheric \t\t\trefraction, and whether to use animated slewing. You can also specify which \t\t\tobjects are hidden while the display is in motion. \t\t \t
\t\t KStars displays 126,000 stars, 13,000 deep-sky objects, 88 constellations, \t\t\tall planets, the Sun, the Moon, thousands of comets and asteroids, and the \t\t\tMilky Way. \t\t \t
\t\t The line in the sky that the Sun and all the Planets seem to follow \t\t\tis called the Ecliptic. \t\t \t
\t\t Object positions in KStars include the effects of precession, nutation, \t\t\taberration, atmospheric refraction, and light travel time (for planets). \t\t \t
\t\t The nearest star to the Sun is Rigel Kentaurus (alpha Centauri). \t\t\tThe brightest star in the sky is Sirius (alpha Canis Majoris). \t\t \t
\t\t The large group of galaxies between Leo, Virgo and Coma Berenices \t\t\tis called the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies. \t\t \t
\t\t The large group of clusters and nebulae near the south celestial pole \t\t\tare objects in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a dwarf galaxy in \t\t\torbit around the Milky Way. \t\t \t
\t\t The Messier Catalog is a list of 110 of the brightest non-stellar objects \t\t\tin the sky. It includes such famous objects as the Orion Nebula (M 42), the \t\t\tAndromeda Galaxy (M 31), and the Pleiades (M 45). \t\t \t

Killbots
Classic
The rules used in the original BSD command line version of robots. Nothing fancy, just the basic game elements: no fastbots, no safe teleports, no pushing junkheaps, and a huge game grid. Due to its larger width, it is recommended that you use a theme with narrower tiles to better fit your screen.
Daleks
An approximation of the rules used in Daleks, a robots-like game for early Apple computers. The hero is allotted one energy each round that can be used to power the sonic screwdriver. All other special features are disabled.
The default Killbots game type. Includes a medium size grid, safe teleports, fast enemies and pushable junkheaps.
Easy
An easier version of the "Killbots" game type. Includes a bigger game grid prepopulated with junkheaps, a starting stash of energy and an increasing energy cap.
Energy Crisis
The player starts with 30 energy and cannot earn more. How many rounds can you survive and how many points can you collect before your energy and luck run out?

Tutorial Course
Welcome to the tutorial course for Kolf!
To hit the ball, press and hold the Down Arrow or left mouse button. How long you hold down the mouse button or key determines strength of the shot.
To aim the putter, press the Left (rotate counterclockwise) and Right (rotate clockwise) Arrow keys or use the mouse.
Bridges Bridges can have walls on the top, bottom, left, or right.
Everything Here's a hole that has it all. Have fun with Kolf! -- Jason Katz-Brown
Slopes Slopes are slanted areas of ground that push the ball in the direction that they slope. This direction is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info.
Hit the ball onto the slope and let it roll into cup.
Try out these different types of slopes.
The steepness of a slope is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info. Steepness goes from 8 (steepest) to 1 (shallowest).
Walls Bounce the ball off of the red walls.
Sand Sand is yellow, and slows your ball down.
Puddles (Water) Hitting into a puddle (blue) adds a penalty stroke to your score, and your ball is placed outside the puddle.
Windmills Windmills (brown base with moving arm) have brown walls (or half walls). The speed of the windmill arm may vary for each hole.
Black Holes Black Holes transport the ball to their exit, and eject it at a speed in direct relation to the speed your ball was traveling. Choose Hole- > Show Info to see which Black Hole goes to which exit and the direction the ball will come out.
Floaters Floaters are moving platforms that carry a ball that lands on it. Floaters' speeds vary.

The goal of the game is to put 5 balls of the same color in line.
You can make horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines.
Each turn, three new balls are placed on the board.
Every turn, you can move one ball.
To move a ball, click on it with the mouse, then click where you want the ball to go.
You just moved the blue ball!
Balls can be moved to every position on the board, as long as there are no other balls in their way.
Now we only need one more blue ball.
It seems to be our lucky day!
Almost, try again!
Very good!
Whenever you complete a line you get an extra turn.
This is the end of this tutorial. Feel free to finish the game!

About KDE
KDEis a world-wide network of software engineers, artists, writers, translators and facilitators who are committed to Free Softwaredevelopment. This community has created hundreds of Free Software applications as part of the KDE Development Platform and KDE Software Distribution. KDE is a cooperative enterprise in which no single entity controls the efforts or products of KDE to the exclusion of others. Everyone is welcome to join and contribute to KDE, including you. Visit http://www.kde.orgfor more information about the KDE community and the software we produce.
Software can always be improved, and the KDE team isready to do so. However, you - the user - must tell us when something does not work as expected or could be done better. KDE has a bug tracking system. Visit http://bugs.kde.orgor use the "Report Bug..." dialog from the "Help" menu to report bugs. If you have a suggestion for improvement then you are welcome to use the bug tracking system to register your wish. Make sure you use the severity called "Wishlist".
You do not have to be a software developer to be a member of the KDE team. You can join the national teams that translate program interfaces. You can provide graphics, themes, sounds, and improved documentation. You decide! Visit http://www.kde.org/jobs/for information on some projects in which you can participate. If you need more information or documentation, then a visit to http://techbase.kde.orgwill provide you with what you need.
KDE is available free of charge, but costs are incurred and assets formed in its creation. Thus, the KDE community formed KDE e.V., a non-profit organization legally founded in Tuebingen, Germany. KDE e.V. represents the KDE community in legal and financial matters. See http://www.kde-ev.orgfor information on KDE e.V. KDE benefits from financial support. Most of the funds raised are used to reimburse members and others for expenses they incur when contributing to KDE. You are encouraged to support KDE through a financial donation, using one of the ways described at http://www.kde.org/support/. Thank you very much in advance for your support.

URL: %1
Protocol: %1
Date and time: %1
Additional information: %1
Possible causes:
Possible solutions:
Contact your appropriate computer support system, whether the system administrator, or technical support group for further assistance.
Contact the administrator of the server for further assistance.
Check your access permissions on this resource.
Your access permissions may be inadequate to perform the requested operation on this resource.
The file may be in use (and thus locked) by another user or application.
Check to make sure that no other application or user is using the file or has locked the file.

You may have encountered a bug in the program.
This is most likely to be caused by a bug in the program. Please consider submitting a full bug report as detailed below.
Update your software to the latest version. Your distribution should provide tools to update your software.
When all else fails, please consider helping the KDE team or the third party maintainer of this software by submitting a high quality bug report. If the software is provided by a third party, please contact them directly. Otherwise, first look to see if the same bug has been submitted by someone else by searching at the KDE bug reporting website. If not, take note of the details given above, and include them in your bug report, along with as many other details as you think might help.
There may have been a problem with your network connection.
There may have been a problem with your network configuration. If you have been accessing the Internet with no problems recently, this is unlikely.
There may have been a problem at some point along the network path between the server and this computer.
Try again, either now or at a later time.
A protocol error or incompatibility may have occurred.
Ensure that the resource exists, and try again.
The specified resource may not exist.
You may have incorrectly typed the location.
Double-check that you have entered the correct location and try again.
Check your network connection status.
Cannot Open Resource For Reading
This means that the contents of the requested file or folder %1 could not be retrieved, as read access could not be obtained.
You may not have permissions to read the file or open the folder.
Cannot Open Resource For Writing
This means that the file, %1, could not be written to as requested, because access with permission to write could not be obtained.
Cannot Initiate the %1 Protocol
Unable to Launch Process
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol could not be started. This is usually due to technical reasons.
The program which provides compatibility with this protocol may not have been updated with your last update of KDE. This can cause the program to be incompatible with the current version and thus not start.
Internal Error
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an internal error.
Improperly Formatted URL
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered was not properly formatted. The format of a URL is generally as follows: protocol: / /user: password@www. example. org: port/ folder/ filename. extension? query=value
Unsupported Protocol %1
The protocol %1 is not supported by the KDE programs currently installed on this computer.
The requested protocol may not be supported.
The versions of the %1 protocol supported by this computer and the server may be incompatible.
You may perform a search on the Internet for a KDE program (called a kioslave or ioslave) which supports this protocol. Places to search include http: / /kde-apps. org/ and http: / /freshmeat. net/.
URL Does Not Refer to a Resource.
Protocol is a Filter Protocol
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered did not refer to a specific resource.
KDE is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol; the protocol specified is only for use in such situations, however this is not one of these situations. This is a rare event, and is likely to indicate a programming error.
Unsupported Action: %1
The requested action is not supported by the KDE program which is implementing the %1 protocol.
This error is very much dependent on the KDE program. The additional information should give you more information than is available to the KDE input/ output architecture.
Attempt to find another way to accomplish the same outcome.
File Expected
The request expected a file, however the folder %1 was found instead.
This may be an error on the server side.
Folder Expected
The request expected a folder, however the file %1 was found instead.
File or Folder Does Not Exist
The specified file or folder %1 does not exist.
The requested file could not be created because a file with the same name already exists.
Try moving the current file out of the way first, and then try again.
Delete the current file and try again.
Choose an alternate filename for the new file.
The requested folder could not be created because a folder with the same name already exists.
Try moving the current folder out of the way first, and then try again.
Delete the current folder and try again.
Choose an alternate name for the new folder.
Unknown Host
An unknown host error indicates that the server with the requested name, %1, could not be located on the Internet.
The name that you typed, %1, may not exist: it may be incorrectly typed.
Access Denied
Access was denied to the specified resource, %1.
You may have supplied incorrect authentication details or none at all.
Your account may not have permission to access the specified resource.
Retry the request and ensure your authentication details are entered correctly.
Write Access Denied
This means that an attempt to write to the file %1 was rejected.
Unable to Enter Folder
This means that an attempt to enter (in other words, to open) the requested folder %1 was rejected.
Folder Listing Unavailable
Protocol %1 is not a Filesystem
This means that a request was made which requires determining the contents of the folder, and the KDE program supporting this protocol is unable to do so.
Cyclic Link Detected
UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location. KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was (perhaps in a roundabout way) linked to itself.
Delete one part of the loop in order that it does not cause an infinite loop, and try again.
Request Aborted By User
The request was not completed because it was aborted.
Retry the request.
Cyclic Link Detected During Copy
UNIX environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and/ or location. During the requested copy operation, KDE detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i. e. the file was (perhaps in a roundabout way) linked to itself.
Could Not Create Network Connection
Could Not Create Socket
This is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications (a socket) could not be created.
The network connection may be incorrectly configured, or the network interface may not be enabled.
Connection to Server Refused
The server %1 refused to allow this computer to make a connection.
The server, while currently connected to the Internet, may not be configured to allow requests.
The server, while currently connected to the Internet, may not be running the requested service (%1).
A network firewall (a device which restricts Internet requests), either protecting your network or the network of the server, may have intervened, preventing this request.
Connection to Server Closed Unexpectedly
Although a connection was established to %1, the connection was closed at an unexpected point in the communication.
A protocol error may have occurred, causing the server to close the connection as a response to the error.
URL Resource Invalid
Protocol %1 is not a Filter Protocol
The U niform R esource L ocator (URL) that you entered did not refer to a valid mechanism of accessing the specific resource, %1%2.
KDE is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol. This request specified a protocol be used as such, however this protocol is not capable of such an action. This is a rare event, and is likely to indicate a programming error.
Unable to Initialize Input/ Output Device
Could Not Mount Device
The requested device could not be initialized ("mounted"). The reported error was: %1
The device may not be ready, for example there may be no media in a removable media device (i. e. no CD-ROM in a CD drive), or in the case of a peripheral/ portable device, the device may not be correctly connected.
You may not have permissions to initialize ("mount") the device. On UNIX systems, often system administrator privileges are required to initialize a device.
Check that the device is ready; removable drives must contain media, and portable devices must be connected and powered on.; and try again.
Unable to Uninitialize Input/ Output Device
Could Not Unmount Device
The requested device could not be uninitialized ("unmounted"). The reported error was: %1
The device may be busy, that is, still in use by another application or user. Even such things as having an open browser window on a location on this device may cause the device to remain in use.
You may not have permissions to uninitialize ("unmount") the device. On UNIX systems, system administrator privileges are often required to uninitialize a device.
Check that no applications are accessing the device, and try again.
Cannot Read From Resource
This means that although the resource, %1, was able to be opened, an error occurred while reading the contents of the resource.
You may not have permissions to read from the resource.
Cannot Write to Resource
This means that although the resource, %1, was able to be opened, an error occurred while writing to the resource.
You may not have permissions to write to the resource.
Could Not Listen for Network Connections
Could Not Bind
This is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications (a socket) could not be established to listen for incoming network connections.
Could Not Listen
Could Not Accept Network Connection
This is a fairly technical error in which an error occurred while attempting to accept an incoming network connection.
You may not have permissions to accept the connection.
Could Not Login: %1
An attempt to login to perform the requested operation was unsuccessful.
Could Not Determine Resource Status
Could Not Stat Resource
An attempt to determine information about the status of the resource %1, such as the resource name, type, size, etc., was unsuccessful.
The specified resource may not have existed or may not be accessible.

Out of Memory
The program on your computer which provides access to the %1 protocol could not obtain the memory required to continue.
Unknown Proxy Host
While retrieving information about the specified proxy host, %1, an Unknown Host error was encountered. An unknown host error indicates that the requested name could not be located on the Internet.
There may have been a problem with your network configuration, specifically your proxy's hostname. If you have been accessing the Internet with no problems recently, this is unlikely.
Double-check your proxy settings and try again.
Authentication Failed: Method %1 Not Supported
Although you may have supplied the correct authentication details, the authentication failed because the method that the server is using is not supported by the KDE program implementing the protocol %1.
Please file a bug at http: / /bugs. kde. org/ to inform the KDE team of the unsupported authentication method.
Request Aborted
Internal Error in Server
The program on the server which provides access to the %1 protocol has reported an internal error: %2.
This is most likely to be caused by a bug in the server program. Please consider submitting a full bug report as detailed below.
Contact the administrator of the server to advise them of the problem.
If you know who the authors of the server software are, submit the bug report directly to them.
Timeout Error
Although contact was made with the server, a response was not received within the amount of time allocated for the request as follows: Timeout for establishing a connection: %1 seconds Timeout for receiving a response: %2 seconds Timeout for accessing proxy servers: %3 seconds Please note that you can alter these timeout settings in the KDE System Settings, by selecting Network Settings - > Connection Preferences.
The server was too busy responding to other requests to respond.

KWallet - The KDE Wallet System
Welcome to KWallet, the KDE Wallet System. KWallet allows you to store your passwords and other personal information on disk in an encrypted file, preventing others from viewing the information. This wizard will tell you about KWallet and help you configure it for the first time.
& Basic setup (recommended)
& Advanced setup
Various applications may attempt to use the KDE wallet to store passwords or other information such as web form data and cookies. If you would like these applications to use the wallet, you must enable it now and choose a password. The password you choose cannot be recovered if it is lost, and will allow anyone who knows it to obtain all the information contained in the wallet.
Yes, I wish to use the KDE wallet to store my personal information.
Enter a new password:
Verify password:
The KDE Wallet system stores your data in a wallet file on your local hard disk. The data is only written in encrypted form, presently using the blowfish algorithm with your password as the key. When a wallet is opened, the wallet manager application will launch and display an icon in the system tray. You can use this application to manage your wallets. It even permits you to drag wallets and wallet contents, allowing you to easily copy a wallet to a remote system.
The KDE Wallet system allows you to control the level of security of your personal data. Some of these settings do impact usability. While the default settings are generally acceptable for most users, you may wish to change some of them. You may further tune these settings from the KWallet control module.

KDE Audio CD IO Slave
(c) 2000 - 2005 Audio CD developers
Audio CDs The Audio CD IO-Slave enables you to easily create wav, MP3 or Ogg Vorbis files from your audio CD-ROMs or DVDs. The slave is invoked by typing "audiocd: /" in Konqueror's location bar. In this module, you can configure encoding, and device settings. Note that MP3 and Ogg Vorbis encoding are only available if KDE was built with a recent version of the LAME or Ogg Vorbis libraries.
Highest
Lowest
/ dev/ cdrom
Specify a location for the drive you want to use. Normally, this is a file inside the / dev folder representing your CD or DVD drive.
& Specify CD Device:
Uncheck this if you want to specify a CD device different from the one autoprobed
If you uncheck this option, the slave will not try to use error correction which can be useful for reading damaged CDs. However, this feature can be problematic in some cases, so you can switch it off here.

Uninvited Connections
Allow & uninvited connections
Select this option to allow connecting without inviting. This is useful if you want to access your desktop remotely.
Announce service & on the network
If you allow uninvited connections and enable this option, Desktop Sharing will announce the service and your identity on the local network, so people can find you and your computer.
Confirm uninvited connections & before accepting
If enabled, a dialog will appear when somebody attempts to connect, asking you whether you want to accept the connection.
Allow uninvited connections to control the desktop
Enable this option to allow uninvited user to control your desktop (using mouse and keyboard).
Password:
If you allow uninvited connections, it is highly recommended to set a password in order to protect your computer from unauthorized access.
& Network
Network Port
Assign port automatically
Check this option to assign the network port automatically. This is recommended unless your network setup requires you to use a fixed port, for example because of a firewall.
Port:
Enter the TCP port number here
Use this field to set a static port number for the desktop sharing service. Note that if the port is already in use the Desktop Sharing service will not be accessible until you free it. It is recommended to assign the port automatically unless you know what you are doing. Most VNC clients use a display number instead of the actual port. This display number is the offset to port 5900, so port 5901 has the display number 1.

Phone number:
& Add...
Specifies the phone numbers to dial. You can supply multiple numbers here, simply click on "Add". You can arrange the order the numbers are tried by using the arrow buttons. When a number is busy or fails, kppp will try the next number and so on
Authentication:
Script-based
PAP
Terminal-based
CHAP
PAP/ CHAP
Specifies the method used to identify yourself to the PPP server. Most universities still use Terminal- or Script-based authentication, while most ISP use PAP and/ or CHAP. If unsure, contact your ISP. If you can choose between PAP and CHAP, choose CHAP, because it is much safer. If you do not know whether PAP or CHAP is right, choose PAP/ CHAP.
Store & password
When this is turned on, your ISP password will be saved in kppp's config file, so you do not need to type it in every time. Warning: your password will be stored as plain text in the config file, which is readable only to you. Make sure nobody gains access to this file!
Callback phone number
Customize & pppd Arguments...
Here you can select commands to run at certain stages of the connection. The commands are run with your real user id, so you cannot run any commands here requiring root permissions (unless, of course, you are root). Be sure to supply the whole path to the program otherwise kppp might be unable to find it.
& Before connect:
Allows you to run a program before a connection is established. It is called immediately before dialing has begun. This might be useful, e. g. to stop HylaFAX blocking the modem.
& Upon connect:
Allows you to run a program after a connection is established. When your program is called, all preparations for an Internet connection are finished. Very useful for fetching mail and news
Before & disconnect:
Allows you to run a program before a connection is closed. The connection will stay open until the program exits.
Upon disconnect:
Allows you to run a program after a connection has been closed.
Configuration
Dynamic IP address
Select this option when your computer gets an internet address (IP) every time a connection is made. Almost every Internet Service Provider uses this method, so this should be turned on.
Static IP address
Select this option when your computer has a fixed internet address (IP). Most computers do not have one, so you should probably select dynamic IP addressing unless you know what you are doing.
& IP address:
If your computer has a permanent internet address, you must supply your IP address here.
& Subnet mask:
If your computer has a static Internet address, you must supply a network mask here. In almost all cases this netmask will be 255.255.255.0, but your mileage may vary. If unsure, contact your Internet Service Provider
& Auto-configure hostname from this IP
Whenever you connect, this reconfigures your hostname to match the IP address you got from the PPP server. This may be useful if you need to use a protocol which depends on this information, but it can also cause several problems. Do not enable this unless you really need it.
Selecting this option might cause some weird problems with the X-server and applications while kppp is connected. Do not use it unless you know what you are doing. For more information take a look at the handbook (or help) in the "Frequently asked questions" section.
Domain & name:
If you enter a domain name here, this domain name is used for your computer while you are connected. When the connection is closed, the original domain name of your computer is restored. If you leave this field blank, no changes are made to the domain name.
Configuration:
Automatic
Manual
DNS & IP address:
Allows you to specify a new DNS server to be used while you are connected. When the connection is closed, this DNS entry will be removed again. To add a DNS server, type in the IP address of the DNS server here and click on Add
& Add
Click this button to add the DNS server specified in the field above. The entry will then be added to the list below
Click this button to remove the selected DNS server entry from the list below
DNS address & list:
This shows all defined DNS servers to use while you are connected. Use the Add and Remove buttons to modify the list
& Disable existing DNS servers during connection
When this option is selected, all DNS servers specified in / etc/ resolv. conf are temporary disabled while the dialup connection is established. After the connection is closed, the servers will be re-enabled Typically, there is no reason to use this option, but it may become useful under some circumstances.
Default gateway
This makes the PPP peer computer (the computer you are connected to with your modem) to act as a gateway. Your computer will send all packets not going to a computer inside your local net to this computer, which will route these packets. This is the default for most ISPs, so you should probably leave this option on.
Static gateway
Allows you to specify which computer you want to use as gateway (see Default Gateway above)
Gateway & IP address:
& Assign the default route to this gateway
If this option is enabled, all packets not going to the local net are routed through the PPP connection. Normally, you should turn this on

Add Phone Number

pppd version:
pppd & timeout:
sec
kppp will wait this number of seconds to see if a PPP connection is established. If no connection is made in this time frame, kppp will give up and kill pppd.
Dock into panel on connect
After a connection is established, the window is minimized and a small icon in the KDE panel represents this window. Clicking on this icon will restore the window to its original location and size.
Automatic redial on disconnect
When a connection is established and it somehow gets disconnected, kppp will try to reconnect to the same account. See here for more on this topic.
Automatic redial on NO & CARRIER
& Show clock on caption
When this option is checked, the window title shows the time since a connection was established. Very useful, so you should turn this on
Disconnect on X server shutdown
Checking this option will close any open connection when the X-server is shut down. You should enable this option unless you know what you are doing. See here for more on this.
& Quit on disconnect
When this option is turned on, kppp will be closed when you disconnect
Minimize window on connect

Modem & name:
Type in a unique name for this modem
Modem device:
This specifies the serial port your modem is attached to. On Linux/ x86, typically this is either / dev/ ttyS0 (COM1 under DOS) or / dev/ ttyS1 (COM2 under DOS). If you have an internal ISDN card with AT command emulation (most cards under Linux support this), you should select one of the / dev/ ttyIx devices.
& Flow control:
Software [XON/ XOFF]
Specifies how the serial port and modem communicate. You should not change this unless you know what you are doing. Default: CRTSCTS
& Line termination:
Specifies how AT commands are sent to your modem. Most modems will work fine with the default CR/ LF. If your modem does not react to the init string, you should try different settings here Default: CR/ LF
Connection speed:
Specifies the speed your modem and the serial port talk to each other. You should begin with at least 115200 bits/ sec (or more if you know that your serial port supports higher speeds). If you have connection problems, try to reduce this value.
& Use lock file
To prevent other programs from accessing the modem while a connection is established, a file can be created to indicate that the modem is in use. On Linux an example file would be / var/ lock/ LCK.. ttyS1 Here you can select whether this locking will be done. Default: On
Modem & timeout:
This specifies how long kppp waits for a CONNECT response from your modem. The recommended value is 30 seconds.
& Wait for dial tone before dialing
Normally the modem waits for a dial tone from your phone line, indicating that it can start to dial a number. If your modem does not recognize this sound, or your local phone system does not emit such a tone, uncheck this option Default:: On
Busy wait:
Specifies the number of seconds to wait before redial if all dialed numbers are busy. This is necessary because some modems get stuck if the same number is busy too often. The default is 0 seconds, you should not change this unless you need to.
Modem & volume:
Most modems have a speaker which makes a lot of noise when dialing. Here you can either turn this completely off or select a lower volume. If this does not work for your modem, you must modify the modem volume command.
Modem asserts CD line
This controls how kppp detects that the modem is not responding. Unless you are having problems with this, do not modify this setting. Default: Off
Modem Commands...
Allows you to change the AT command for your modem.
& Query Modem...
Most modems support the ATI command set to find out vendor and revision of your modem. Press this button to query your modem for this information. It can be useful to help you set up the modem
& Terminal...
Opens the built-in terminal program. You can use this if you want to play around with your modem's AT command set

Use this to specify the performance of your connection. Note that you should select the speed of the weakest link - even if you have a high speed connection, it will not help you if the remote computer uses a slow modem. Choosing a level of quality that is too high on a slow link will cause slower response times. Choosing a lower quality will increase latencies in high speed connections and results in lower image quality, especially in'Low Quality 'mode.

These certificates will be deleted even though you did not explicitly select them (Why?):
Why do you want to delete more certificates than I selected? When you delete CA certificates (both root CAs and intermediate CAs), the certificates issued by them will also be deleted. This can be nicely seen in Kleopatra's hierarchical view mode: In this mode, if you delete a certificate that has children, those children will also be deleted. Think of CA certificates as folders containing other certificates: When you delete the folder, you delete its contents, too.

Refreshing X.509 certificates implies downloading CRLs for all certificates, even if they might otherwise still be valid. This can put a severe strain on your own as well as other people's network connections, and can take up to an hour or more to complete, depending on your network connection, and the number of certificates to check. Are you sure you want to continue?

No OpenPGP directory services have been configured. If not all of the certificates carry the name of their preferred certificate server (few do), a fallback server is needed to fetch from.

Do you want to continue with keys. gnupg. net as fallback server?

Message Part Properties
The MIME type of the file: normally, you do not need to touch this setting, since the type of the file is automatically checked; but, sometimes, %1 may not detect the type correctly -- here is where you can fix that.
The size of the part: sometimes, %1 will only give an estimated size here, because calculating the exact size would take too much time; when this is the case, it will be made visible by adding "(est.)" to the size displayed.
The file name of the part: although this defaults to the name of the attached file, it does not specify the file to be attached; rather, it suggests a file name to be used by the recipient's mail agent when saving the part to disk.
& Description:
A description of the part: this is just an informational description of the part, much like the Subject is for the whole message; most mail agents will show this information in their message previews alongside the attachment's icon.
& Encoding:
The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.
Suggest & automatic display
Check this option if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this part in the message preview, instead of the default icon view; technically, this is carried out by setting this part's Content-Disposition header field to "inline" instead of the default "attachment".
& Sign this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be signed; the signature will be made with the key that you associated with the currently-selected identity.
Encrypt this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted; the part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message

HTML Messages
WARNING: Allowing HTML in email may increase the risk that your system will be compromised by present and anticipated security exploits. More about HTML mails... More about external references...
Messages sometimes come in both formats. This option controls whether you want the HTML part or the plain text part to be displayed. Displaying the HTML part makes the message look better, but at the same time increases the risk of security holes being exploited. Displaying the plain text part loses much of the message's formatting, but makes it almost impossible to exploit security holes in the HTML renderer (Konqueror). The option below guards against one common misuse of HTML messages, but it cannot guard against security issues that were not known at the time this version of KMail was written. It is therefore advisable to not prefer HTML to plain text. Note: You can set this option on a per-folder basis from the Folder menu of KMail's main window.
Prefer HTML to plain text
Some mail advertisements are in HTML and contain references to, for example, images that the advertisers employ to find out that you have read their message ("web bugs"). There is no valid reason to load images off the Internet like this, since the sender can always attach the required images directly to the message. To guard from such a misuse of the HTML displaying feature of KMail, this option is disabled by default. However, if you wish to, for example, view images in HTML messages that were not attached to it, you can enable this option, but you should be aware of the possible problem.

This selects which mailbox format will be the default for local folders: mbox: KMail's mail folders are represented by a single file each. Individual messages are separated from each other by a line starting with "From". This saves space on disk, but may be less robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders. maildir: KMail's mail folders are represented by real folders on disk. Individual messages are separate files. This may waste a bit of space on disk, but should be more robust, e. g. when moving messages between folders.

This is the list of defined filters. They are processed top-to-bottom. Click on any filter to edit it using the controls in the right-hand half of the dialog.
Click this button to create a new filter. The filter will be inserted just before the currently-selected one, but you can always change that later on. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Delete button.
Click this button to copy a filter. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Delete button.
Click this button to delete the currently-selected filter from the list above. There is no way to get the filter back once it is deleted, but you can always leave the dialog by clicking Cancel to discard the changes made.
Click this button to move the currently-selected filter up one in the list above. This is useful since the order of the filters in the list determines the order in which they are tried on messages: The topmost filter gets tried first. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Down button.
Click this button to move the currently-selected filter down one in the list above. This is useful since the order of the filters in the list determines the order in which they are tried on messages: The topmost filter gets tried first. If you have clicked this button accidentally, you can undo this by clicking on the Up button.
Click this button to rename the currently-selected filter. Filters are named automatically, as long as they start with "lt;". If you have renamed a filter accidentally and want automatic naming back, click this button and select Clear followed by OK in the appearing dialog.
Check this button to force the confirmation dialog to be displayed. This is useful if you have defined a ruleset that tags messages to be downloaded later. Without the possibility to force the dialog popup, these messages could never be downloaded if no other large messages were waiting on the server, or if you wanted to change the ruleset to tag the messages differently.

Please note that this feature can cause some POP3 servers that do not support pipelining to send corrupted mail; this is configurable, though, because some servers support pipelining but do not announce their capabilities. To check whether your POP3 server announces pipelining support use the "Check What the Server Supports" button at the bottom of the Security tab in this dialog; if your server does not announce it, but you want more speed, then you should do some testing first by sending yourself a batch of mail and downloading it.

Congratulations, you have upgraded to KNode version %1. Unfortunately this version uses a different format for some data-files, so in order to keep your existing data it is necessary to convert it first. This is now done automatically by KNode. If you want to, a backup of your existing data will be created before the conversion starts.

Automatically archive items older than:
If this feature is enabled, KOrganizer will regularly check if events and to-dos have to be archived; this means you will not need to use this dialog box again, except to change the settings.

Message Part Properties
The MIME type of the file: normally, you do not need to touch this setting, since the type of the file is automatically checked; but, sometimes, %1 may not detect the type correctly -- here is where you can fix that.
The size of the part: sometimes, %1 will only give an estimated size here, because calculating the exact size would take too much time; when this is the case, it will be made visible by adding "(est.)" to the size displayed.
& Name:
The file name of the part: although this defaults to the name of the attached file, it does not specify the file to be attached; rather, it suggests a file name to be used by the recipient's mail agent when saving the part to disk.
& Description:
A description of the part: this is just an informational description of the part, much like the Subject is for the whole message; most mail agents will show this information in their message previews alongside the attachment's icon.
& Encoding:
The transport encoding of this part: normally, you do not need to change this, since %1 will use a decent default encoding, depending on the MIME type; yet, sometimes, you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message, e. g. if a PostScript file does not contain binary data, but consists of pure text -- in this case, choosing "quoted-printable" over the default "base64" will save up to 25% in resulting message size.
Suggest & automatic display
Check this option if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic (inline) display of this part in the message preview, instead of the default icon view; technically, this is carried out by setting this part's Content-Disposition header field to "inline" instead of the default "attachment".
& Sign this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be signed; the signature will be made with the key that you associated with the currently-selected identity.
Encrypt this part
Check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted; the part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message

Kate comes with a nice set of plugins, providing simple and advanced features of all sorts. You can enable/ disable plugins to suit your needs in the configuration dialog, choose Settings -gt; configure to launch that.
You can swap the characters on each side of the cursor just by pressing Ctrl+T
You can export the current document as a HTML file, including syntax highlighting. Just choose File -gt; Export -gt; HTML...
You can split the Kate editor as many times as you like and in either direction. Each frame has its own status bar and can display any open document. Just choose View -gt; Split [Horizontal _BAR_ Vertical]
You can drag the Tool views (File List and File Selector) to any side that you want them in Kate, or stack them, or even tear them off the main window.
Kate has a built-in terminal emulator, just click on "Terminal" at the bottom to show or hide it as you desire.
Kate can highlight the current line with a different background color. _BAR_ You can set the color in the Colors page of the configuration dialog.
You can open the currently edited file in any other application from within Kate. Choose File -gt; Open With for the list of programs configured for the document type. There is also an option Other... to choose any application on your system.
You can configure the editor to always display the line numbers and/ or bookmark panes when started from the View Defaults page of the configuration dialog.
You can download new or updated Syntax highlight definitions from the Highlighting page in the configuration dialog. Just click the Download... button on the Open/ Save -gt; Modes & Filetypes tab (You have to be online, of course...).
You can cycle through all open documents by pressing Alt+Left or Alt+Right. The next/ previous document will immediately be displayed in the active frame.
You can do cool sed-like regular expression replacements using Command Line. For example, press F7 and enter s / oldtext/ newtext/ g to replace & quot; oldtextquot; with & quot; newtextquot; throughout the current line.
You can repeat your last search by just pressing F3, or Shift+F3 if you want to search backwards.
You can filter the files displayed in the File Selector tool view. Simply enter your filter in the filter entry at the bottom, for example: *. html *. php if you only want to see HTML and PHP files in the current folder. The File Selector will even remember your filters for you .< strong >
You can have two views - or even more - of the same document in Kate. Editing in either will be reflected in both. So if you find yourself scrolling up and down to look at text at the other end of a document, just press Ctrl+Shift+T to split horizontally.
Press F8 or Shift+F8 to switch to the next/ previous frame.

These options allow you to have the File Selector automatically change location to the folder of the active document on certain events. Auto synchronization is lazy, meaning it will not take effect until the file selector is visible. None of these are enabled by default, but you can always sync the location by pressing the sync button in the toolbar.
If this option is enabled (default), the location will be restored when you start Kate. Note that if the session is handled by the KDE session manager, the location is always restored.
If this option is enabled (default), the current filter will be restored when you start Kate. Note that if the session is handled by the KDE session manager, the filter is always restored. Note that some of the autosync settings may override the restored location if on.

Click this button to select a background image not yet present in the list above.
This area will always display the currently selected background image. Note that the image will be scaled and thus might have a different ratio than it originally had.
In this box, you can set various settings that control how the background image is displayed.
& Intensity in%:
Here you can select how much the image should be brightened up so that it does not disturb the selected area too much. Different images require different settings, but 25% is a good value to start with.
If you check this box, the selected image will be scaled to fit the total size of the selected area. Image ratio will be adjusted to match the area size and height if necessary.
If you check this box, the selected image will be centered over the selected area. If the image is larger then the area, you will only see the middle part of it.

All Stencils This will cause the entire page to be exported to the file. This means that all stencils will be exported.
Crop picture to edges
Do n't export extra blank space to file
Crop picture to edges This will eliminate all blank portions of the drawing. The picture will only be as large as the stencils it contains. If your stencils are located in the upper right corner of the page, then only the upper right corner will be exported.
& Quality:
The higher the quality, the more space the file takes up
Quality Not all file formats use this. But for those that do, this affects the quality of the image that gets exported. 100 is the maximum quality. The higher the number, the better the picture looks. The downside is the higher the number, the larger the filesize.
An optional border of whitespace around the page, in pixels
Border Places a blank border around the edges of the image. This can be used if for one reason or another, the stencils do n't fit into the export page with a 0-pixel border (default).

& Encoding
Select the encoding of the Write document. Try the Default Encoding (CP 1252), if unsure.
& Other encoding:
& Default encoding (CP 1252)
Most Write documents are stored using this encoding (also known as windows-1252). Select this if unsure.
& Advanced
These advanced options allow you to fine-tune the importing of formatting information. They compensate for differences between KWord and MS Write by adding extra formatting information (not found in the original document), to try to make the imported document look as close to the original as possible. It is safe to use the defaults, if unsure.
Compensate for & linespacing differences
Try to simulate Write's linespacing by adding some spaces before each paragraph.
Enable & image positioning
Use paragraph indentation to position images.

Bit Operations
First number
Second number
The BITAND() function performs a bit-wise AND operation for the two integer parameters.
BITAND(value; value)
The BITLSHIFT() function performs a bit-wise left shift operation of the first parameter. The number of bits to shift by is specified by the second parameter. Note that a negative number of bits to left shift by becomes a right shift.
The BITRSHIFT() function performs a bit-wise right shift operation of the first parameter. The number of bits to shift by is specified by the second parameter. Note that a negative number of bits to right shift by becomes a left shift.
The BITOR() function performs a bit-wise OR operation for the two integer parameters.
BITOR(value; value)
The BITXOR() function performs a bit-wise exclusive-OR operation for the two integer parameters.
BITXOR(value; value)

Type
Linear (2,4,6,...)
Generate a series from'start 'to'end' and for each step add the value provided in step. This creates a series where each value is'step 'larger than the value before it.
Geometric (2,4,8,...)
Generate a series from'start 'to'end' and for each step multiply the value with the value provided in step. Using a step of 5 produces a list like: 5, 25, 125, 625 since 5 multiplied by 5 (step) equals 25, and that multiplied by 5 equals 125, which multiplied by the same step-value of 5 equals 625.
Start value:
Stop value:
Step value:
End and start value must be positive.
End value must be greater than the start value or the step must be less than '1 '.
Step is negative.
The step value must be greater than zero; otherwise, the linear series is infinite.
If the start value is greater than the end value the step must be less than zero.
If the step is negative, the start value must be greater then the end value.

Document directory (DocumentRoot) The root directory for HTTP documents that are served. By default the compiled-in directory. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ doc
Error log (ErrorLog) The error log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ error_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ error_log
Font path (FontPath) The path to locate all font files (currently only for pstoraster). By default / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts. ex: / usr/ share/ cups/ fonts
Log level (LogLevel) Controls the number of messages logged to the ErrorLog file and can be one of the following: debug2: Log everything. debug: Log almost everything. info: Log all requests and state changes. warn: Log errors and warnings. error: Log only errors. none: Log nothing. ex: info
Max log size (MaxLogSize) Controls the maximum size of each log file before they are rotated. Defaults to 1048576 (1MB). Set to 0 to disable log rotating. ex: 1048576
Page log (PageLog) The page log file; if this does not start with a leading / then it is assumed to be relative to ServerRoot. By default set to "/ var/ log/ cups/ page_log". You can also use the special name syslog to send the output to the syslog file or daemon. ex: / var/ log/ cups/ page_log
Preserve job history (PreserveJobHistory) Whether or not to preserve the job history after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is Yes. ex: Yes
Preserve job files (PreserveJobFiles) Whether or not to preserve the job files after a job is completed, canceled, or stopped. Default is No. ex: No

Server files (ServerRoot) The root directory for the scheduler. By default / etc/ cups. ex: / etc/ cups
User (User) The user the server runs under. Normally this must be lp, however you can configure things for another user as needed. Note: the server must be run initially as root to support the default IPP port of 631. It changes users whenever an external program is run... ex: lp
Group (Group) The group the server runs under. Normally this must be sys, however you can configure things for another group as needed. ex: sys
RIP cache (RIPCache) The amount of memory that each RIP should use to cache bitmaps. The value can be any real number followed by "k" for kilobytes, "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, or "t" for tiles (1 tile = 256x256 pixels). Defaults to "8m" (8 megabytes). ex: 8m
Temporary files (TempDir) The directory to put temporary files in. This directory must be writable by the user defined above! Defaults to "/ var/ spool/ cups/ tmp" or the value of the TMPDIR environment variable. ex: / var/ spool/ cups/ tmp
Filter limit (FilterLimit) Sets the maximum cost of all job filters that can be run at the same time. A limit of 0 means no limit. A typical job may need a filter limit of at least 200; limits less than the minimum required by a job force a single job to be printed at any time. The default limit is 0 (unlimited). ex: 200
Listen to (Port/ Listen) Ports/ addresses that are listened to. The default port 631 is reserved for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and is what is used here. You can have multiple Port/ Listen lines to listen to more than one port or address, or to restrict access. Note: Unfortunately, most web browsers do n't support TLS or HTTP Upgrades for encryption. If you want to support web-based encryption you will probably need to listen on port 443 (the "HTTPS" port...). ex: 631, myhost:80, 1.2.3.4:631
Hostname lookups (HostNameLookups) Whether or not to do lookups on IP addresses to get a fully-qualified hostname. This defaults to Off for performance reasons... ex: On

Use short names (BrowseShortNames) Whether or not to use "short" names for remote printers when possible (e. g. "printer" instead of "printer@host"). Enabled by default. ex: Yes
Browse addresses (BrowseAddress) Specifies a broadcast address to be used. By default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces. Note: HP-UX 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless you have a Class A, B, C, or D netmask (i. e. no CIDR support). ex: x. y. z.255, x. y.255.255
Browse allow/ deny (BrowseAllow/ BrowseDeny) BrowseAllow: specifies an address mask to allow for incoming browser packets. The default is to allow packets from all addresses. BrowseDeny: specifies an address mask to deny for incoming browser packets. The default is to deny packets from no addresses. Both "BrowseAllow" and "BrowseDeny" accept the following notations for addresses: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The hostname/ domainname restrictions only work if you have turned hostname lookups on!
Browse interval (BrowseInterval) The time between browsing updates in seconds. Default is 30 seconds. Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates. Set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are not advertised but you can still see printers on other hosts. ex: 30
Browse order (BrowseOrder) Specifies the order of BrowseAllow/ BrowseDeny comparisons. ex: allow, deny
Browse poll (BrowsePoll) Poll the named server(s) for printers. ex: myhost:631
Browse port (BrowsePort) The port used for UDP broadcasts. By default this is the IPP port; if you change this you need to do it on all servers. Only one BrowsePort is recognized. ex: 631
Browse relay (BrowseRelay) Relay browser packets from one address/ network to another. ex: src-address dest-address
Browse timeout (BrowseTimeout) The timeout (in seconds) for network printers - if we do n't get an update within this time the printer will be removed from the printer list. This number definitely should not be less the BrowseInterval value for obvious reasons. Defaults to 300 seconds. ex: 300
Implicit classes (ImplicitClasses) Whether or not to use implicit classes. Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes. conf file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or both. When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name (e. g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN without a lot of administrative difficulties. If a user sends a job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available queue. Enabled by default.
System group (SystemGroup) The group name for "System" (printer administration) access. The default varies depending on the operating system, but will be sys, system, or root (checked for in that order). ex: sys
Encryption certificate (ServerCertificate) The file to read containing the server's certificate. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. crt
Encryption key (ServerKey) The file to read containing the server's key. Defaults to "/ etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key". ex: / etc/ cups/ ssl/ server. key
Access permissions # Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to DocumentRoot... # AuthType: the authorization to use: # None - Perform no authentication Basic - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method. Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method. # (Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the localhost interface) # AuthClass: the authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported. # AuthGroupName: the group name for "Group" authorization. # Order: the order of Allow/ Deny processing. # Allow: allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. # Deny: denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. # Both "Allow" and "Deny" accept the following notations for addresses: # All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm # The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above. # Encryption: whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler. # Possible values: # Always - Always use encryption (SSL) Never - Never use encryption Required - Use TLS encryption upgrade IfRequested - Use encryption if the server requests it # The default value is "IfRequested".
Authentication (AuthType) The authorization to use: None - Perform no authentication. Basic - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method. Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method. Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the localhost interface.
Class (AuthClass) The authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User, System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
The user/ group names allowed to access the resource. The format is a comma separated list.
Satisfy (Satisfy) This directive controls whether all specified conditions must be satisfied to allow access to the resource. If set to "all", then all authentication and access control conditions must be satisfied to allow access. Setting Satisfy to "any" allows a user to gain access if the authentication or access control requirements are satisfied. For example, you might require authentication for remote access, but allow local access without authentication. The default is "all".
Authentication group name (AuthGroupName) The group name for Group authorization.
ACL order (Order) The order of Allow/ Deny processing.
Allow Allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. Possible values are: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above.
ACL addresses (Allow/ Deny) Allows/ Denies access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or network. Possible values are: All None *. domain. com. domain. com host. domain. com nnn. * nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. * nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mm nnn. nnn. nnn. nnn/ mmm. mmm. mmm. mmm The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with "HostNameLookups On" above.
Encryption (Encryption) Whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler. Possible values: Always - Always use encryption (SSL) Never - Never use encryption Required - Use TLS encryption upgrade IfRequested - Use encryption if the server requests it The default value is "IfRequested".
Access permissions Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler. Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
Auto purge jobs (AutoPurgeJobs) Automatically purge jobs when not needed for quotas. Default is No.
Browse protocols (BrowseProtocols) Which protocols to use for browsing. Can be any of the following separated by whitespace and/ or commas: all - Use all supported protocols. cups - Use the CUPS browse protocol. slp - Use the SLPv2 protocol. The default is cups. Note: If you choose to use SLPv2, it is strongly recommended that you have at least one SLP Directory Agent (DA) on your network. Otherwise, browse updates can take several seconds, during which the scheduler will not response to client requests.
Classification (Classification) The classification level of the server. If set, this classification is displayed on all pages, and raw printing is disabled. The default is the empty string. ex: confidential
Allow overrides (ClassifyOverride) Whether to allow users to override the classification on printouts. If enabled, users can limit banner pages to before or after the job, and can change the classification of a job, but cannot completely eliminate the classification or banners. The default is off.
Hide implicit members (HideImplicitMembers) Whether or not to show the members of an implicit class. When HideImplicitMembers is On, any remote printers that are part of an implicit class are hidden from the user, who will then only see a single queue even though many queues will be supporting the implicit class. Enabled by default.
Use & quot; anyquot; classes (ImplicitAnyClasses) Whether or not to create AnyPrinter implicit classes. When ImplicitAnyClasses is On and a local queue of the same name exists, e. g. "printer", "printer@server1", "printer@server1", then an implicit class called "Anyprinter" is created instead. When ImplicitAnyClasses is Off, implicit classes are not created when there is a local queue of the same name. Disabled by default.
Max jobs (MaxJobs) Maximum number of jobs to keep in memory (active and completed). Default is 0 (no limit).
Max jobs per user (MaxJobsPerUser) The MaxJobsPerUser directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each user. Once a user reaches the limit, new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed, stopped, aborted, or canceled. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality. Default is 0 (no limit).
Max jobs per printer (MaxJobsPerPrinter) The MaxJobsPerPrinter directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each printer or class. Once a printer or class reaches the limit, new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed, stopped, aborted, or canceled. Setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality. Default is 0 (no limit).
Port The port value that the CUPS daemon is listening to. Default is 631.
Address The address that the CUPS daemon is listening at. Leave it empty or use an asterisk (*) to specify a port value on the entire subnetwork.
Check this box if you want to use SSL encryption with this address/ port.

Welcome to the CUPS Server Configuration Tool
Welcome
This tool will help you to configure graphically the server of the CUPS printing system. The available options are grouped into sets of related topics and can be accessed quickly through the icon view located on the left. Each option has a default value that is shown if it has not been previously set. This default value should be OK in most cases. You can access a short help message for each option using either the '?' button in the title bar, or the button at the bottom of this dialog.

KDE Printing Management
(c) 2000 - 2002 Michael Goffioul
Michael Goffioul
Printers The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.) What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system.

The [print$] share must exist on the Samba side prior to clicking the Export button below.
Samba username User needs to have write access to the [print$] share on the Samba server. [print$] holds printer drivers prepared for download to Windows clients. This dialog does not work for Samba servers configured with security = share (but works fine with security = user).

These options will automatically put fonts in the PostScript file which are not present on the printer. Font embedding usually produces better print results (closer to what you see on the screen), but larger print data as well.
When using font embedding you can select additional directories where KDE should search for embeddable font files. By default, the X server font path is used, so adding those directories is not needed. The default search path should be sufficient in most cases.

This area contains the status messages for the game. Most of these messages are sent to you from the current engine.
This is the command line. You can type special commands related to the current engine in here. Most relevant commands are also available through the menus.
This is the button bar tool bar. It gives you easy access to game related commands. You can drag the bar to a different location within the window.
This is the status bar. It shows you the currently selected engine in the left corner.

Timer
Autosave
After you finished your moves, they have to be sent to the engine. You can either do that manually (in which case you should not enable this feature), or you can specify an amount of time that has to pass before the move is committed. If you undo a move during the timeout, the timeout will be reset and restarted once you finish the move. This is very useful if you would like to review the result of your move.
Enable timeout
Move timeout in seconds:
Check the box to enable all the messages that you have previously disabled by choosing the "Do not show this message again" option.
Reenable all messages
Check the box to automatically save all window positions on program exit. They will be restored at next start.
Save settings on exit
You can enable the menubar again with the right mouse button menu of the board.

Set Dice Values
Set the face values of the selected dice. The other player's dice will be cleared and it will be the dice's owner's turn.
This is a regular field of the backgammon board. Checkers can be placed on this field and if the current state of the game and the dice permit this, they can be moved by dragging them to their destination or by using the'short move 'feature.
This part of the backgammon board is the home. Depending on the direction of the game, one of the homes contains the dice and the other one contains checkers that have been moved off the board. Checkers can never be moved away from the home. If this home contains the dice and the current state of the game permits this, double clicking on the dice will roll them. Moreover, the cube might be placed on the home bar and if it can be doubled, double clicking it will do so.

Your regular expression is invalid. 'Look Ahead 'regular expression must be the last sub expression.
Regular Expression Editor What you are currently looking at is an editor for Regular Expressions. The upper part in the middle is the editing area, the lower part is a verification window where you can try your regular expressions right away. The row of buttons is the editing actions. This is actually very similar to common drawing programs. Select an editing tool to start editing your regular expression, and press the mouse button in the editing area where you want this item inserted. For a more detailed description of this editor see the info pages What is a regular expression? If you do not know what a regular expression is, then it might be a good idea to read the introduction to regular expressions.

Your names
Selection tool
This will change the state of the editor to selection state. In this state you will not be inserting regexp items, but instead select them. To select a number of items, press down the left mouse button and drag it over the items. When you have selected a number of items, you may use cut/ copy/ paste. These functions are found in the right mouse button menu.
Text
This will insert a text field, where you may write text. The text you write will be matched literally. (i. e. you do not need to escape any characters)
A single character specified in a range
This will match a single character from a predefined range. When you insert this widget a dialog box will appear, which lets you specify which characters this regexp item will match.
Any character
This will match any single character
Repeated content
This regexp item will repeat the regexp items it surrounds a specified number of times. The number of times to repeat may be specified using ranges; e. g. it could be specified that it should match from 2 to 4 times, that it should match exactly 5 times, or that it should match at least one time. Examples: If you specify that it should match any time, and the content it surrounds is abc, then this regexp item will match the empty string, the string abc, the string abcabc, the string abcabcabcabc, etc.
This regexp item will match any of its alternatives. Alternatives are specified by placing regexp items on top of each other inside this widget.
Compound regexp
This regexp item serves two purposes: It makes it possible for you to collapse a huge regexp item into a small box. This makes it easier for you to get an overview of large regexp items.
