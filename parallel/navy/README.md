Hi Kenneth,



I’m happy if you put the release the data publicly. Perhaps you can just add some acknowledgement to the Department of E&E Engineering at Stellenbosch University.



Kind regards

Dear Alexandra and Kenneth,

 

Hope you enjoyed the rest of your South African visit and managed to make it safely back home.

 

After a bit of digging around I managed to find the English-isiXhosa parallel text corpus that was created in 2008 for a research project. We created the corpus as part of a prototype speech-to-speech translation system we developed for the South African Navy.

 

I’ve attached a zip file of the data. The sentences are numbered and for the English data each sentence is on its own line. It does appear as if the isiXhosa data some of the sentences span more than one line.

 

I am not certain about the quality of the translation (you might want to have someone do a spot check), but hopefully this data could be useful.

 

Kind regards

Herman
