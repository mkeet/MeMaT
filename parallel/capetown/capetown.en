SCHEDULE 1 Standards and specifications for fuel-burning equipment:
1. All fuel-burning equipment capable of burning more than 100kg/h of coal, biomass or other solid fuel shall be fitted with suitable control equipment so as to limit dust and grit emissions.
2. The control equipment shall be fitted in such a manner so as to facilitate easy maintenance.
3. The permitted concentration of grit and dust emissions from a chimney serving a coal fired boiler equipped with any mechanical draught fan system shall not be more than 250 mg/Nm 3 (as measured at 0 C, 101,3 kPa and 12% CO2).
Where the fuel-burning equipment has been declared as a Controlled Emitter in terms of the Air Quality Act, the respective Controlled Emitter Regulations shall apply. The approved methods for testing shall be:
US EPA:
1. Method 17 - In-Stack Particulate (PM).
2. Method 5 - Particulate Matter (PM).
ISO standards: ISO 9096: Stationary source emissions - Manual Determination of mass concentration of particulate matter.
British standards: BS 3405:1983 Method for measurement of particulate emission including grit and dust (simplified method).
4. The City reserves the right to call upon the owner or his or her agent of the fuel burning equipment to have the emissions from such fuel burning equipment evaluated at his or her own expense as may be required by the authorised official.
Insulation of chimneys: All fuel-burning equipment using Heavy Fuel Oil or other liquid fuels with a sulphur content equal to or greater than 2.5 % by weight must be fitted with a fully insulated chimney using either a 25mm air gap or mineral wool insulation to prevent the formation of acid smut.
Such chimneys must be maintained in a good state of repair at all times.
Wood-fired pizza ovens and other solid fuel combustion equipment: Wood-fired pizza ovens and other solid fuel combustion equipment shall be fitted with induced draft fans at the discretion of the authorised official.
24 Province of the Western Cape: Provincial Gazette Extraordinary 7662 17 August 2016
SCHEDULE 2 Good management practices to prevent or minimise the discharge of smoke from open burning of vegetation
1. Consider alternatives to burning e.g. mulching for recovery of nutrient value, drying for recovery as firewood.
2. Vegetation that is to be burned (such as trimmings, pruning or felling s cut from active growth) should as a general guide be allowed to dry to brown appearance prior to burning.
3. Except for tree stumps or crop stubble, the place of combustion should be at least 50 metres from any road other than a highway, and 100 metres from any highway or dwelling on a neighbouring property.
4. Due regard should be given to direction and strength of wind, and quantity and state of vegetation to be combusted, prior to initiating combustion.
5. In the case of vegetation previously treated by spray with any agrichemical, any manufacturer's instructions as on the label of any container in respect of the burning of treated vegetation must be observed.
6. Two days' fine weather should be allowed prior to burning.
7. Vegetation should be stacked loosely rather than compacted.
8. A small fire, started with the driest material, with further material continually fed onto it once it is blazing, is preferable to a large stack ignited and left unattended.
Note: Persons conducting open burning of vegetation must ensure compliance with the requirements of the National Veld and Forest Fire Act, 1998, (Act No. 101 of 1998) as amended.
