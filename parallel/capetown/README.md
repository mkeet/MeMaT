These are bylaws of the City of Cape Town collected from their website.

We think they are "Official texts of a legislative, administrative or legal nature, or in official translations of such texts, or in speeches of a political nature or in speeches delivered in the course of legal proceedings, or in news of the day that are mere items of press information" and therefore not subject to copyright under South African law.  

They were collected from the [City of Cape Town website](http://www.capetown.gov.za/) which has an annoying copyright clause.  

These were the only three which I found to be easily amenable to conversion to text and alignment.
